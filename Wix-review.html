<h6>What is wix?</h6>

<p>Wix is the most popular website creator and one of the largest in the world. Founded in 2006 in Israel, Wix has revolutionized the market by offering a free tool that allows anyone to create their own website, without knowledge of design or programming. Until then, to have a professional website you had to invest a lot of money. With Wix, creating a beautiful and free website has become possible and easy to do. It is not for nothing that he became so popular. 

To give a dimension of what Wix is, the company has more than 90 million users, in the more than 190 countries where it operates. And every day, about 45 thousand new users register on the platform. To meet all this demand, Wix has more than 1,200 employees, in offices located in 7 countries. 

Despite having been launched for so many years, Wix has been growing and updating its platform to continue offering the most modern website creation. In this review we will show how Wix works and all the features of the tool.
</p>


<h6>Who is Wix for? </h6>

<p>Wix is perfect for those who have no technical knowledge due to its ease of use. Its features are simple and intuitive. With it you can have a beautiful and professional website without having to understand anything about programming and development.

    Another excellent tool is WordPress, for those looking for more flexibility, scalability and control over their website. 
    </p>

<h6>How does Wix work?</h6>

<p>The Wix works so easy and intuitively. To start, just register your email (or your Facebook or Google account) on the tool's homepage . Once this is done, you are ready to create your website. 

    The first step is to select a category according to the theme of your website (restaurant, hotel, business, etc.). For each category there is a series of templates (themes) for you to view and choose from. When you have chosen your theme, the editor will open for you to start customizing your site. 
    
    The great asset of Wix is its ease of editing. Thanks to the drag and drop feature, you are free to insert and move content anywhere on the site. In addition, the tool has well-located and organized editing menus, making it easy to use even by new Wix users. You can also edit any element on the page, just by clicking on it and choosing one of the options. If something went wrong, just click back to return to the previous state.
    
    During creation you can save your site as many times as you want, and build it little by little, without worrying about losing anything. Once you're satisfied with the result, just click publish and you're done: your website is live! This goes for any account, paid or free. That is, it is really possible to publish a free website on Wix.
    </p>

<h6>Wix Plans</h6>

<p>Although Wix is a free website creator, it has several paid plans (Premium), which have more features and flexibility. Altogether there are 7 Premium plans, divided into two groups:  for people and for business. 

    The main differences from the free plan to the paid plans are the storage space and bandwidth, the possibility of using a custom domain, the display of Wix ads, the support level and the e-commerce functionality. 
    </p>

<h6>Initial Wix plans (suitable for people) </h6>

<p>In addition to the free, Wix offers 4 more plans for people who want to create a website. These are plans with adequate resources for those who are just starting out or who do not need business-oriented features, such as large storage space and online payment (e-commerce).</p>

<h6>Wix plans for online businesses </h6>

<p>For businesses that need to have an internet presence, Wix offers 3 more paid plans. The differentials of these plans, compared to the others, are the large storage space and the functionalities aimed at business and e-commerce.</p>

<h6><u>The following features are also included in paid plans:</u></h6>

<ul>
    <li>Unlimited pages - Wix does not limit plans by the number of pages, giving the user more freedom. </li>
    <li>Hosting - users do not need to book a hosting, as it is already offered free by Wix.</li>
    <li>Custom favicon - you can insert a custom favicon (icon) into any paid plan. </li>
    <li>SSL Certificate (https://) - all plans, including the free one, have the security certificate included. </li>
    <li>Free domain - annual or biannual plans (from Basic) have 1 year of free domain.</li>
    <li>Support - Wix has an online help center for all users. However, paid plans have priority response on the platform, and the most robust, also have telephone support. </li>
    <li>Guaranteed refund - in case of customer dissatisfaction, the company offers a 14-day refund period. When canceling the plan within that period, Wix refunds the money paid.</li>
    <li>The e-mail service is not included in Wix plans. If you want to have a professional email service, you must hire a professional email service , such as G Suite , also resold by Wix. </li>
</ul>

<h6><u>Wix features</u></h6>

<p>Wix is the most complete website creator on the market, with varied features and great quality. Learn about the main features of the tool:</p>

<h6>Wix ADI</h6>

<p>Wix ADI is really a hand in the wheel for those who are in a hurry and don't know where to start. To create the website with this functionality, simply create your Wix account and click on any of the buttons to start creating the website. After choosing the segment, the tool will ask if you prefer to use Wix ADI or if you want to create the site with the Wix Editor. 

    After you click on the Wix ADI option, the tool will ask you a few questions about the website you want to create like what you want on your site, if you want a blog, an online store, if you need a form, what style of template do you prefer, if you want something cleaner or more chic, the name of your business, among other questions that will help you set up the site with everything you need and in the style you like best. 
    
    With Wix ADI you can have a beautiful and professional website without much effort, being able to edit your images, texts and other details of the website. The editing allowed by ADI is limited, if you want more freedom you can migrate to the Wix Editor later and edit it the way you prefer.
