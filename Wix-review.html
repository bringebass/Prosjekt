    <h2 class="headline6">Introduction</h2>

<h3 class="spacez2">Suitable for</h3>

<p class="spacez">Who wants to create their own website or online store, and does not have technical knowledge. </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Summary</h3>

<p class="spacez">Wix is the easiest to use website creator and earns many points for the amount of resources, in addition to the free option, ideal for those who want to test before hiring.</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">What is wix?</h3>

<p class="spacez">
    


    Wix is the most popular website creator and one of the largest in the world. Founded in 2006 in Israel, Wix has revolutionized the market by offering a free tool that allows anyone to create their own website, without knowledge of design or programming. Until then, to have a professional website you had to invest a lot of money. With Wix, creating a beautiful and free website has become possible and easy to do. It is not for nothing that he became so popular. 

   
<br/><br/>
To give a dimension of what Wix is, the company has more than 90 million users, in the more than 190 countries where it operates. And every day, about 45 thousand new users register on the platform. To meet all this demand, Wix has more than 1,200 employees, in offices located in 7 countries. 
<br/><br/>
Despite having been launched for so many years, Wix has been growing and updating its platform to continue offering the most modern website creation. In this review we will show how Wix works and all the features of the tool.



</p>



<h3 class="spacez2">Who is Wix for? </h3>

<p class="spacez">Wix is perfect for those who have no technical knowledge due to its ease of use. Its features are simple and intuitive. With it you can have a beautiful and professional website without having to understand anything about programming and development.
    <br/><br/>
    Another excellent tool is WordPress, for those looking for more flexibility, scalability and control over their website. 
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">How does Wix work?</h3>

<p class="spacez">The Wix works so easy and intuitively. To start, just register your email (or your Facebook or Google account) on the tool's homepage . Once this is done, you are ready to create your website. 
    <br/><br/>
    The first step is to select a category according to the theme of your website (restaurant, hotel, business, etc.). For each category there is a series of templates (themes) for you to view and choose from. When you have chosen your theme, the editor will open for you to start customizing your site. 
    <br/><br/>
    The great asset of Wix is its ease of editing. Thanks to the drag and drop feature, you are free to insert and move content anywhere on the site. In addition, the tool has well-located and organized editing menus, making it easy to use even by new Wix users. You can also edit any element on the page, just by clicking on it and choosing one of the options. If something went wrong, just click back to return to the previous state.
    <br/><br/>
    During creation you can save your site as many times as you want, and build it little by little, without worrying about losing anything. Once you're satisfied with the result, just click publish and you're done: your website is live! This goes for any account, paid or free. That is, it is really possible to publish a free website on Wix.
    </p>

<h2 class="headline6">Wix Plans</h2>

<p class="spacez">Although Wix is a free website creator, it has several paid plans (Premium), which have more features and flexibility. Altogether there are 7 Premium plans, divided into two groups:  for people and for business. 
    <br/><br/>
    The main differences from the free plan to the paid plans are the storage space and bandwidth, the possibility of using a custom domain, the display of Wix ads, the support level and the e-commerce functionality. 
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Initial Wix plans for private individuals</h3>

<p class="spacez">In addition to the free, Wix offers 4 more plans for people who want to create a website. These are plans with adequate resources for those who are just starting out or who do not need business-oriented features, such as large storage space and online payment (e-commerce).</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Wix plans for online businesses </h3>

<p class="spacez">For businesses that need to have an internet presence, Wix offers 3 more paid plans. The differentials of these plans, compared to the others, are the large storage space and the functionalities aimed at business and e-commerce.</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">The following features are also included in paid plans:</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="spacez">Unlimited pages - Wix does not limit plans by the number of pages, giving the user more freedom. </li>
    <li class="spacez">Hosting - users do not need to book a hosting, as it is already offered free by Wix.</li>
    <li class="spacez">Custom favicon - you can insert a custom favicon (icon) into any paid plan. </li>
    <li class="spacez">SSL Certificate (https://) - all plans, including the free one, have the security certificate included. </li>
    <li class="spacez">Free domain - annual or biannual plans (from Basic) have 1 year of free domain.</li>
    <li class="spacez">Support - Wix has an online help center for all users. However, paid plans have priority response on the platform, and the most robust, also have telephone support. </li>
    <li class="spacez">Guaranteed refund - in case of customer dissatisfaction, the company offers a 14-day refund period. When canceling the plan within that period, Wix refunds the money paid.</li>
    <li class="spacez">The e-mail service is not included in Wix plans. If you want to have a professional email service, you must hire a professional email service , such as G Suite , also resold by Wix. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="headline6">Wix features</h2>

<p class="spacez">Wix is the most complete website creator on the market, with varied features and great quality. Learn about the main features of the tool:</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Wix ADI</h3>

<p class="spacez">Wix ADI is really a hand in the wheel for those who are in a hurry and don't know where to start. To create the website with this functionality, simply create your Wix account and click on any of the buttons to start creating the website. After choosing the segment, the tool will ask if you prefer to use Wix ADI or if you want to create the site with the Wix Editor. 
    <br/><br/>
    After you click on the Wix ADI option, the tool will ask you a few questions about the website you want to create like what you want on your site, if you want a blog, an online store, if you need a form, what style of template do you prefer, if you want something cleaner or more chic, the name of your business, among other questions that will help you set up the site with everything you need and in the style you like best. 
    <br/><br/>
    With Wix ADI you can have a beautiful and professional website without much effort, being able to edit your images, texts and other details of the website. The editing allowed by ADI is limited, if you want more freedom you can migrate to the Wix Editor later and edit it the way you prefer. 
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">More than 500 professional themes </h3>

<p class="spacez">One of the strengths of Wix is in the themes offered. There are more than 500 templates for you to create your website, divided into more than 70 categories. Whether you are a photographer, dentist, professional, restaurant owner, designer, architect, student, there are many professional templates created for what you do. 
    <br/><br/>
    In addition, Wix also offers one-page themes, ideal for sites with little content, and blank themes for those who prefer to start from scratch. 
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Mobile-optimized themes</h3>

<p class="spacez">Wix themes are optimized for mobile and can be edited separately if you want to add or remove content only for mobile. In other words, you have the freedom to display personalized content to anyone who accesses it by cell phone. For example, if you have a local business, you can give more evidence to your address and phone number right on the main page.
    <br/><br/>
    To get even better, they just needed to offer responsive themes, which dynamically adjust to different types of screens. In the case of Wix, it has only the main version (desktop) and the mobile version. This characteristic, however, is not a problem. The most important thing is to ensure a good user experience, whether using a computer or a cell phone. And this is accomplished by the Wix website creator. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Easy and intuitive website editor </h3>

    <p class="spacez">The Wix website editing tool is very easy to use. The menus are well located and all are well divided and organized, with supporting images and text. It is also possible to edit by clicking directly on any element on the page, which brings up the options available for that element. If something went wrong, just click back to return to the previous state.
        <br/><br/>
        The customization possibilities are many. You can edit images, colors, fonts, text, shapes, links and buttons, insert transitions between pages, customize the menu, pages, insert contact forms, social network icons and everything else you want. 
        </p>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Images and multimedia</h3>

    <p class="spacez">Another differential of Wix compared to other tools is the quality of images and visual aids . For example, the free professional image bank , which includes photos, icons and customizable cliparts. The creator also allows you to import your images from the computer, import images from your social networks (which is a hand in the wheel!) And use an external image bank, at reduced prices.
        <br/><br/>
        Shapes and objects can also be used on your website and are useful to give a different touch to a title or section of the website. If you don't have a logo, you can use a symbol to support your website's name. In the theme we chose, the site title comes with an icon like that.
        <br/><br/>
        An interesting feature offered by Wix is the free image editor. With it you can touch up, edit and enhance any image. You can test and see the results in the editor itself.
        <br/><br/>
        Wix also offers features that enhance the site's images, such as image galleries and banners, which include gifs and images with parallax scrolling. These visuals are a trend and convey a beautiful and professional image of the website. It is also possible to add music and videos very easily, already integrated with applications such as YouTube and Spotify.
        </p>

        <h3 class="spacez2">Wix Blog </h3>

        <p class="spacez">In one click you can add a blog to your website. There are several templates to choose from and the editor is easy to use. You can also insert parts of your blog on any page of the site, inviting the visitor to read the content of your blog.
            <br/><br/>
            The blog is available for free and paid accounts and is interesting to make your site more dynamic and help you gain visibility on Google.
            </p>

        <h3 class="spacez2">Wix Online Store </h3>
        <p class="spacez">
        Creating an online store is also simple: The option is available in the website editor. The virtual store is optimized for mobile , has product galleries, inventory management and several payment methods, including PayPal. 
        <br/><br/>
It is possible to create an online store for free, but to accept online payments you must upgrade to Wix eCommerce or VIP plans. There is no commission for Wix for selling its products on the website.
</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Applications </h3>

<p class="spacez">Wix offers more than 250 applications for you to add to your site, several of which are free. Some of the apps include: contact form, gift certificate, poll, live chat, event calendar, restaurant reservations, email marketing and more.</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Free Wix hosting </h3>

<p class="spacez">As with all website creators, Wix hosting is included and free for all customers of the company. That is, when using Wix, it is not necessary to hire a hosting. This represents a monthly savings of around $10 to $25 per month, which must be considered. 
    <br/><br/>
    Hosting resources vary according to the plan used. The free version offers 500 MB of storage and 500 MB of bandwidth, which serves very small sites with little traffic. Paid plans reach up to 20GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth. This storage limit applies to most sites, but may be insufficient for very large online stores. The same goes for bandwidth, which is related to website traffic. 
    <br/><br/>
    As for the availability time, it is over 99.9%. This indicates that it is a stable accommodation, which is not frequently down.
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">SEO on Wix </h3>

<p class="spacez">

There was already a lot of controversy when it came to Wix and SEO, but we can say that this was in the past and that nowadays the tool is quite satisfactory in this regard. 
<br/><br/>
With Wix you can make use of practically all good SEO practices: You can define your page title and meta description, indicate alternative text for images, build friendly URLs, among others. Besides, it already comes with some features that are very important to ensure a good position in search engines, such as SSL certificate and a great load time and availability (uptime). 
<br/><br/>
The website builder also guarantees indexing in seconds. You can find your site on Google the instant after its publication, which does not mean that it will be on the first page as soon as it is published, but you will not have to wait days or even weeks for it to be indexed. 
<br/><br/>
Wix also has its own free SEO tool, Wiz, which designs customized SEO plans according to your website. It's great for those who are taking their first steps on this long road of search engine optimization. 
<br/><br/>
If you produce relevant content for your audience and use the resources offered by the tool, you will have no problem getting a good position on Google. Either way, keep in mind that this is something that takes time, regardless of the platform chosen to build your website. 

</p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Advanced editing </h3>

<p class="spacez">For those who want a little more customization and have some technical knowledge (or know someone who can help) Wix has the developer tools. With them you can create databases, custom forms with user information, add behavior with JavaScript and much more. To activate these tools, just hover over “code” in the editor's top menu and click on “activate developer tools”. </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Professional email </h3>

<p class="spacez">The e-mail service is not included in any of the Wix plans, what the tool does is reseller G Suite , Google's suite of applications, in which you pay a monthly fee for each email account. Nothing prevents you from hiring another professional email service and connecting your domain to these accounts. </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Domain in Wix </h3>

<p class="spacez">To connect a custom domain to your Wix site, you need to hire one of the premium plans. With the free plan, your domain will have the following structure: username.wixsite.com/nameofsite. This is certainly not the ideal URL, because in addition to not giving a professional image to those looking for your site, it is also not advisable in terms of SEO. However, it can work initially, and as your site becomes concrete you buy a domain and upgrade to a premium plan. 
    <br/><br/>
    In premium plans you can either buy the domain with Wix itself, connect a domain already registered or transfer it from another company. The price of the domain on Wix is not disclosed on the website. If you prefer, you can register the domain with another company. 
    <br/><br/>
    When you buy a domain directly on Wix, it will automatically connect to your website. And since the creator offers a free domain for a year on annual subscription to some of the premium plans, it is worth keeping an eye on. In addition, in Wix it is also possible to register domains with different endings such as .net, .org, .wiki, .guru, .design and so on. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Support</h3>

<p class="spacez">

    You can get help from the Wix support team in three different ways: by sending a question through the website (in which case the answer comes in your email); requesting a call (the company states that the delay time is 3 minutes on average); and the help center of the website itself, which is quite complete and divided into different categories, making it easier to find the answer you need. 
    <br/><br/>
To send your question and request the support team call, you need to find the Wix contact page, which can be a very difficult task since the link is nowhere obvious. It was necessary to search the help center for “sending a question” to be able to find the page.
<br/><br/>
Some of the premium plans offer differentiated support for their subscribers, such as the VIP plan, which gives access to a special support team, and eCommerce, which has 24/7 phone support every day. 
<br/><br/>
There is also the tool blog that has several tutorials that can help in the process of creating the site and managing your Wix account. 
<br/><br/>
Wix was lacking support via chat, which can be very practical for quick questions and that need an immediate answer. 

</p>

                <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
                <p>Thewebsitecentral.com provides professional web services reviews fully independent of any other entity. Our assessments of the service providers are fair and balanced, and we only recommend service providers that we believe provide the most value to our readers. While compensation is sometimes received from some of the companies listed on this site (when links are used to make a purchase), service providers can not pay to change or eliminate our reviews.</p> 
            </br>
                    <p>In addition, the prices and services posted in our reviews are changed by the service providers on a frequent basis. Thewebsitecentral.com is regularly updating the reviews, but are not always informed by the service providers of changes in their services and can therefore not guarantee that the information is 100% accurate at any given time. Therefore, all readers must always consult the service provider’s web pages for the most updated information regarding their respective service offerings.</p>
