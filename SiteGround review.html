<h6 class="spacez2">What is Siteground?</h6>

<p class="spacez">
    


    Siteground provides services of wordpress hosting, web hosting, woocommerce hosting and cloud hosting. Siteground allows you to install WordPress in a few minutes without having special computer knowledge. It’s data centers are located in various geographical points, so as to provide maximum performance and therefore maximum loading of website pages.

Siteground is a London based Company established in 2004 by several college companions. It has developed into a main web facilitating hosting specialist provider. Today the company employs around 140 representatives and is continually growing. It generates per day: 

</p>

<ul>
    <li class="spacez">300 calls</li>
    <li class="spacez">600 help tickets </li>
    <li class="spacez">800 visit demands. </li>
    <li class="spacez">Runs something like 320,000 domains.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="spacez2">What is Siteground For?</h6>

<p class="spacez">SiteGround's features are excellent both for those who want to host a single site at affordable prices, and for those who need more advanced solutions.

    SiteGround is currently one of the best choices to evaluate for any online project.
    
    </p>

<h6 class="spacez2">How does Siteground Work?</h6>

<p class="spacez">

    The great advantage of SiteGround hosting is to be able to perfectly balance extreme ease of use, excellent performance and good value for money.

One of the most delicate aspects of a hosting service is certainly assistance. SiteGround is able to offer you 24/7 support (Saturdays and Sundays included), through which you can explain your problem in writing and wait for the response from the SiteGround operator. Generally the answer always arrives within 10/15 minutes maximum.

Furthermore, with SiteGround you can choose to activate your hosting plan in the geographically closest location to that of your visitors. This hosting has data centers spread over 3 continents: America, Europe and Asia. In Europe, the 3 main server farms are in England, the Netherlands and Germany. SiteGround's data centers use Google Cloud infrastructure.

With SiteGround you have the opportunity to always take advantage of the most advanced technologies in terms of hosting. From ultra-fast SSD disks to the latest PHP versions. Thanks to the proprietary SuperCacher system, the pages of your website will load even faster. This means that, in most cases, you don't even need additional plugins for your WordPress site's cache.

Their hosting service provides free SSL certificates of "Let's Encrypt" and this allows you to activate your site already with the secure HTTPS protocol, which I recommend you do already in the WordPress installation phase.

To activate a hosting plan on SiteGround, go directly to the page dedicated to hosting plans.

The next step is to choose the domain, which is the main address of your site. SiteGround, like many other hosting, allows you to either use a domain that you have already registered with other providers or register one for free directly with SiteGround. 

If this is your first site, you probably haven't registered the domain yet. Then proceed to choose the option "Register a new domain" and enter the name of the domain you have chosen in the appropriate field. From the drop-down menu you can also choose between different domain extensions, such as .it, .com, .net and many others. Once this is done, click on the "Proceed" button.

On the next page enter your email address and choose a password which will be associated with your SiteGround account. If you already have a SiteGround account.

Once you have entered your "Account Information", you can proceed to fill in the section called "Customer Information". Here, in addition to entering your name, surname and other requested data, you will have to choose which person to register your SiteGround account: natural person, freelancer, company, NGO or other person. Based on the choice, other fields may appear such as those for the company name and VAT number.

You can change the duration of the subscription, which by default is set to 12 months. Also remember that on SiteGroundyou can take advantage of a discounted rate on the first billing cycle compared to the normal fee. This means that if you choose the 36 month period you can take advantage of the discounted rate on the fee for the first 3 years of hosting.

SiteGround also recently introduced the option to pay for the hosting service monthly. This is the most flexible option, but also the most expensive one. I recommend starting with the 12 months option.

After the payment, Access the my.siteground.com page and enter the username you find in the email sent by SiteGround and the password you chose during the purchase process you have just concluded.

Once logged into your account, click on the second tab, called "Hosting" or “My Accounts”.

You can choose between WordPress and WordPress + WooCommerce (if you also need e-commerce) and then fill out the simple form to set up a username, password and email address for the site administrator.

As you have seen, installing a site on SiteGround is an extremely simple and quick operation. You now have everything you need to start the adventure of building your new WordPress site.</p>

<h6 class="spacez2">SiteGround Plans</h6>

<p class="spacez">

Siteground offers Shared Hosting, WordPress Hosting, Cloud Hosting and other dedicated Hosting plans. If you have just decided to start with your own website, then the Shared Hosting offer is for you. However, if your site grows, there will be no problem with an upgrade.

Let's look specifically at what these hosting plans are:

</p>

<ul>
    <li class="spacez">
        Shared Hosting: Shared hosting is recommended for those who have decided to start with their own personal site and do not yet have large volumes of traffic so that they can share server resources with other users.
        </li>
    <li class="spacez">WordPress hosting: This plan is the optimized version of shared hosting for WordPress. It has been designed by Siteground to ensure better performance if you choose to use WordPress.</li>
    <li class="spacez">Cloud hosting: it is an upgrade of the shared hosting. It allows you to use the resources of different servers in the cloud architecture. It is recommended for existing web businesses or very popular blogs.</li>
    <li class="spacez">Dedicated Hosting: a dedicated hosting offers you the possibility of having a server at your exclusive service. It is more expensive than the other plans but guarantees you better performance.</li>
</ul>


<h6 class="spacez2">Choice of plan</h6>

<ul>
    <li class="spacez">
        StartUp: This plan is limited to one website. It includes 10GB of space and is suitable for sites that receive up to 10,000 monthly visits. You will also have all the Siteground tools such as the WordPress installer, your old website transfer, daily backups and much more.
        </li>
    <li class="spacez">GrowBig: The GrowBig plan lets you host an unlimited number of sites. It includes up to 20GB of storage and supports up to 25,000 monthly visitors. You will have all the functions of the StartUp package and other additional functions such as priority assistance or the Super Cacher for an even faster loading of your website.</li>
    <li class="spacez">GoGeek: The GoGeek plan has all the features of the GrowBig but allows you to have up to 100,000 monthly visitors and 30GB of web space. You will also have some more advanced features available but here we should get down to more technical details.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="spacez2">SiteGround Features</h6>




<p class="spacez">Lets learn about the main features:</p>

<h6 class="spacez2">Siteground Performance</h6>

<p class="spacez">Although price plays a fundamental role in choosing a hosting, it is often not worth compromising your results to save a few dollars for performance limitations.

    Siteground in terms of performance is at the top of the best hosting and is also optimized for WordPress. If you don't believe it, try it yourself.
    </p>

<h6 class="spacez2">Siteground speed test</h6>

<p class="spacez">Speed is one of the most important factors to consider. A faster website offers a good browsing experience to the user and helps you rank well in search engines.

    To take a test, you can go to  GTmetrix, insert the link to your site and start the test. 
    Obviously these results are due not only to hosting, but it affects a lot. However, there are ways to speed up a site, after you have chosen a performing hosting.
    
    To test how Siteground's servers respond to the increase in traffic, we can use LoadImpact. This tool gradually comes to test how the server could react up to an increase of 100 users connected simultaneously on your page.
    
    Siteground works without problems up to 50 connected users where you see the peak in the graph. It then recovers quickly and the loading times are stable again.
    
    This proves that if you are looking to build a fast website then Siteground is a great choice for you.
    
    Usually, the websites hosted on shared servers, could suffer slowdowns during the hours where traffic peaks occur. This happens because your site shares web space with many other sites hosted on the same server.
    
    In some cases, the company that provides you with the web space may decide to take your site offline for awhile if you are using too many resources.
    
    </p>

<h6 class="spacez2">SiteGround Server Response Time</h6>



<p class="spacez">The content on your site has a big impact on loading speed. For example, if you have high resolution photos on your page, surely your site will not be able to load lightning fast.

    This means that speed tests don't really depend only on the quality of the hosting service.
    
    So, in addition to the site loading speed, you can also test the server response time with  Bitcatcha. This tool totally ignores the weight of your page, it just tests the response speed of the server.
    
    Siteground is a good choice. The server responds in fractions of a second. 
     
    
    </p>

<h6 class="spacez2">Optimized for WordPress </h6>

<p class="spacez">

    Most of the users use Wordpress, so having an optimized hosting is a competitive advantage from an SEO point of view, because it will be easier to get organic traffic from Google and reach the right people, thus increasing the profits (if you have a commercial web site).
    </p>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Email Service in Siteground</h6>

    <p class="spacez">

        All WordPress hosting plans on SiteGround also provide you with an email service. By registering the domain on SiteGround or by pointing to the name servers of your domain here, you can take advantage of your hosting plan also for the creation of email boxes.
        </p>

        <h6 class="spacez2">Siteground Customer Service</h6>


        <p class="spacez">

            You have probably already heard of Siteground's customer service. They are kind, quick, prepared and always ready to respond to your needs.

            Once you are a customer, you will have 24/7 assistance on the phone or via live chat. You can try the service even if you are not a customer by accessing the site and clicking on the "Live Chat" item at the top right.
            
            For users who prefer to sort things out for themselves, Siteground has a huge library of tutorials, guides, faqs. 
            
            </p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">SEO</h6>


            <p class="spacez">

                Having an excellent web hosting service as such brings enormous benefits in terms of SEO as well.

A fast  and performing site which Siteground brings to its users is always well regarded by Google and being able to position itself in the largest search engine in the world will be much easier.  </p>

<h6 class="spacez2">
    Siteground Rating
    </h6>

<p class="spacez">

    Every hosting company has its strengths and weaknesses. Some advantages can make you choose one hosting over another, but some negative aspects can make a service completely unsuitable for your needs.

Here, we will enlighten some of them about Siteground:

    </p>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Strong points</h6>

    <ul>
        <li class="spacez">Fast servers: all Siteground servers are optimized to make your site fast.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Industry-leading customer support: Siteground's customer support is truly something unique. By phone or chat, always available.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Servers located in various continents: the different location to reach the one you prefer during installation.</li>
        <li class="spacez">High performance: following numerous tests and different rankings Siteground always results in the top 3 fastest hosting (if not in first place), based on the weight of the features that are taken into consideration.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Optimized for WordPress: I use WordPress, as do most of the sites, so having an optimized hosting is a competitive advantage from an SEO point of view, because it will be easier to get organic traffic from Google and reach the right people, thus increasing the profits.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Eco-Friendly: has a particular focus on sustainability. Indeed, Siteground is an eco-friendly hosting (green hosting). I like the fact that it can combine attention to the environment with excellent performance for my site!</li>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Negative Points</h6>

    <p class="spacez">As mentioned earlier, there are drawbacks to every single service on this planet. Here are the ones concerning Siteground:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="spacez">Limited web space: the web space offered is fixed (although this is the case for most hosting). Anyway, it's more than enough to get started with your web project, you don't have to worry about it, but a reasoning should be done in case you need a lot of space. At most you can do a simple upgrade of the Siteground plan, without affecting the stability of the site.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Cost: Surely if you are attentive to the various promos that are made online, you will find some hosting service that will cost you less than Siteground. However, it is unlikely that you can find the same quality of the services offered and above all the same assistance service (I know that at the moment you think you don't need it, but assistance is needed by everyone if your site goes offline, is attacked, has some fatal error or you wanted to try a new theme or plugin that are not compatible).</li>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Pros and Cons</h6>


    <h6 class="spacez2">Pros</h6>

  <ul>
        <li class="spacez">Far faster than other similarly priced services</li>
        <li class="spacez">Extremely safe</li>
        <li class="spacez">Great for WordPress</li>
        <li class="spacez">Automatic installation of all major CMS (WordPress, Joomla, Magento, etc..)</li>
        <li class="spacez">The transfer of the site does it to them for free.</li>
        <li class="spacez">Excellent assistance</li>
        <li class="spacez">The first domain is free</li>
        <li class="spacez">Daily backup included in the price</li>
        <li class="spacez">Extremely easy to perform backup restore</li>
        <li class="spacez">Free SSL certificate</li>
        <li class="spacez">Create an unlimited number of emails</li>
        <li class="spacez">From the GrowBig plan onwards, you can create multiple websites on the same space</li>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Cons</h6>

    <ul>
        <li class="spacez">Limited space</li>
        <li class="spacez">Limited resources (perhaps the biggest flaw)</li>
        <li class="spacez">Shared plans are not suitable for large sites</li>
        <li class="spacez">Prices slightly higher than average</li>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Conclusion</h6>

    <p class="spacez">If you need fast and reliable hosting, with great customer support, then Siteground is for you. And there are packages available for all budgets and needs. All shared hosting offers also include content migration tools from an old site to a new one and the ability to install WordPress in less than a minute.

        If you are thinking of starting your first site, your first online business, then go without fail with Siteground and get a great performance for a fair price. </p>
