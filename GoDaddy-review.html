    <h2 class="headline6">GoDaddy Plans</h2>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Web Hosting</h3>
    

    <p class="spacez">GoDaddy offers a wide variety of plans, to meet the most diverse needs. 

        GoDaddy's website hosting plans are suitable both for those who are creating the first website and for more robust options, such as blogs and small virtual stores.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to hosting Linux sites, which is the company's most popular, the same service, but with the Windows Server operating system, is also available in this modality. 
        <br /><br />
        All plans of GoDaddy offer 99.9% monthly availability (uptime), a cPanel control panel and a maximum capacity of 250 thousand files. Technical support is available to all customers, however, only Economy plans and superior customers are entitled to advanced support. 
        <br /><br />
        The hosting plans do not include website creators, but it is possible to install dozens of applications automatically, via cPanel. Free SSL certificates are also not included in the plans. Only the Ultimate plan offers the feature, which is free only in the 1st year. After that, the value is $279.99 per year. It is possible to install SSL certificates purchased outside GoDaddy via cPanel. 
        <br /><br />
        A point worth mentioning is e-mail, which is available on all plans via cPanel. You can create up to 100 email accounts. Pay attention to the storage space, which is shared between all accounts and also between the website files. The total is restricted to that offered in the plan in question. Economy and higher plan offer a free professional email account for 1 year. This account is independent of the hosting and offers 10 GB of space for emails only. 
        <br /><br />
        Other extra features offered by GoDaddy (and charged separately) include automatic backup ($5.99/month), protection against malware (from $21.99/month), among others. It is possible to upgrade plans with just one click, via the control panel.
    </p>
    <h3 class="spacez2">Business Hosting</h3>
    <hp class="spacez">GoDaddy Business Hosting proposes to combine the power of a virtual private server (VPS) with the ease of operation of shared hosting. A VPS, being virtualized, works as a dedicated server, isolating resources between clients present on the same server. In practice, the Hosting Business client manages the hosting through a control panel similar to that offered in website hosting (cPanel). The advantage is in the performance of the server, which is more robust and therefore faster than that offered in hosting standard websites. 
        <br /><br />
        In addition to the superior performance, another interesting point of Business Hosting is the availability of a free SSL certificate, something that does not occur in shared hosting plans, where the resource is charged separately. The SSL certificate can be used free of charge as long as the customer remains with the contracted plan. Business hosting customers can create e-mail accounts via cPanel. These accounts share the space with the one used on the website. 
        <br /><br />
        A professional email account with 10 GB of space is also available - free for one year. This service is more robust than the email included in cPanel, however, only one account can be created and the service must be paid for after the first year of use. Shared hosting customers can migrate to Business hosting with just one click. Business plans are indicated for virtual stores and/or high traffic sites that consume a lot of resources.
        <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="spacez2">WordPress Hosting</h3>
    <p class="spacez">GoDaddy WordPress Hosting is aimed at owners and administrators of websites created on the platform who do not wish to deal with the configurations and technical aspects of the hosting. Instead of a complex control panel, like the one offered in other company hosting plans, customers find a panel with the essential resources for managing the service. In addition to the WordPress admin panel itself, of course, present in any installation of the platform. 
        <br /><br />
        But the service is not limited to the management aspect. Several differentials are present, covering security items and offering other facilities to customers.
        <br /><br />
        From a security point of view, GoDaddy's WordPress Hosting plans offer daily malware scans across the entire site (with automatic removal), SSL certificate (from the Ultimate plan) and daily backups with a restore option in just 1 click. 
        <br /><br />
        For convenience, GoDaddy offers automatic updates of WordPress themes, plugins and versions, as well as access to thousands of free themes and plugins and automatic installation and configuration of WordPress, right after hiring. For beginners on the platform, a drag and drop page creator is available and integrated with WordPress. 
        <br /><br />
        In terms of performance, WordPress plans are hosted on servers optimized for the platform and integrated with a CDN, which promises to reduce the loading time of pages by up to 50%. Advanced users can access the server via SFTP, if they wish (from the Deluxe plan).
        <br /><br />
        Other benefits include the availability of the Yoast SEO Premium plugin - whose subscription, if contracted separately, would cost $ 89 per year - and free domain in the first payment cycle (annual or higher). This means that if you choose a 3-year payment cycle, the domain will be free for the first three years, and must be renewed at the current price at the time. 
        <br /><br />
        For customers coming from another hosting and who already have a WordPress site, the company offers a migration wizard, which proposes to perform the automatic migration of the site to GoDaddy's servers, via the control panel.
        <br /><br />
        </p>
    <h3 class="spacez2">Hosting With Self-Managed VPS</h3>
    <p class="spacez">GoDaddy VPS Hosting is aimed at more experienced users who need a robust server, aimed at high performance websites and applications. The management of the virtual server is done by the client (self-managed = unmanaged). All plans have SSD storage technology and have weekly backups. 
        <br /><br />
        Virtual servers are offered in Linux or Windows and may or may not contain a control panel, which can be chosen from cPanel/WHM (Linux) or Plesk (Linux/Windows). In the option without control panel, administration is done via the command line, through SSH connection. 
        <br /><br />
        The plans start from $20.99 per month in the Linux option without a control panel. The company also offers a self-managed VPS modality aimed at applications that require more RAM. 
        <br /><br />
        With regard to prices, there is an advantageous detail for the customer in the renewal: while in the other plans the promotional price is generally only valid in the first payment cycle, in the VPS plans the discount is applied even in the renewal . In other words, if the customer opted for the annual discount cycle, the same discount will be applied to the renewal of the plan, 1 year after the first payment. 
        <br /><br />
        The data center can be chosen from 3 options: North America, Europe or Asia. In case of the need to upgrade the plan, the same can be done with a few clicks on the panel, without the need for migration.
        <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="spacez2">Dedicated Server</h3>
    <p class="spacez">GoDaddy Dedicated Servers are geared towards high performance websites and applications that demand more processing, memory and space than other hosting options can offer. They are offered on both Linux and Windows operating systems. The hardware configurations are the same on both OSs. 
        <br /><br />
        Linux plans start in the Economy option, which includes 4 CPU cores (3.1 GHz each), 4 GB of RAM, 1 TB of storage, unlimited transfer and 3 dedicated IPs.
        <br /><br />
        All plans are offered at two levels of management: Self-managed, where the client is responsible for the complete administration of the server, and Managed, which is managed by the GoDaddy team. The self-managed option offers more operating system options, being CentOS, Fedora and Ubuntu, on Linux servers, and Windows 2008 or 2012. In the managed option, the available OS is CentOS (Linux) or Windows 2008 and 2012. The control panel of the managed version is WHM/cPanel (Linux) or Plesk Odin (Windows). Root access is available in all versions, but must be enabled by the panel in the managed version. 
        <br /><br />
        Storage RAID technology uses more than one disk to store the same information, creating redundancy and protecting the information present on the server against mechanical failures on the disks. All plans use RAID for storage. Backups include only disaster recovery, but regular backups can be contracted separately. 
        <br /><br />
        The processor present in all plans is the Xeon E3-1220-v3, with 4 Cores Cores @ 3.1 GHz, also in all planes. 
        <br /><br />
        GoDaddy offers a free SSL certificate in the first year of service. After this period, it must be paid to continue to be used. It is also possible to install other certificates, issued by third parties. 
        <br /><br />
        For Linux servers, the company informs that the setup of the dedicated servers can take up to 2 days, but it is possible to reduce this period by simply contacting the support team and requesting urgent delivery of the server. Windows servers are delivered in minutes after hiring and payment confirmation.
        <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Website Creator and Online Store</h3>

    <p class="spacez">
        In its Website Builder, GoDaddy has put together a service package aimed at those who wish to create an online presence. Through an easy and intuitive website creation platform, it is possible to create a website, blog or online store with several interesting resources for any business segment. 
        <br /><br />
        The creation of the website is done using GoDaddy's own platform, which allows you to organize sections and pages by dragging and dropping elements. Several customizable themes can be used as a starting point, which include features common to websites, such as contact forms, sharing on social networks, drop-down menus and buttons. 
        <br /><br />
        Among the resources for online stores we can highlight the centralized inventory control, several shipping options, payment methods and online scheduling (for services). The store is aimed at selling both physical and digital products or services. For those who wish to make sales online, the Electronic Commerce plan they must choose.
        <br /><br />
        An additional feature included in the plan is GoDaddy InSight, a tool that provides personalized recommendations for improving your website, based on data obtained on the website itself. 
        <br /><br />
        From the Standard plan, an SEO assistant is available. It provides suggestions on how to optimize the content of your website pages. 
        <br /><br />
        The plans also include free backups and can be tested for free for 30 days, without the need to insert a credit card.

    <h3 class="spacez2">Professional Email</h3>

    <p class="spacez">For those looking to have a more professional presentation when communicating with their customers, GoDaddy offers the professional email service. It allows you to use email with a personalized domain, such as name@yourcompany.com . 
        <br /><br />
        The messages are hosted on GoDaddy's servers in an email service without advertisements, spam filters and with guaranteed uptime (availability time) of 99.9%.
        <br /><br />
        Professional email is offered in 2 plans, differing in storage space (10 GB or 25 GB per account) and in the team's sharing and integration services.
        <br /><br />
        It is worth mentioning that the customer can use his favorite email program to send and receive messages. Alternatively, it is possible to use the webmail provided by GoDaddy with the service.
        <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3 class="spacez2">Microsoft Office 365</h3>

    <p class="spacez">For those who want to use Microsoft technology in their email service - or office suite applications - GoDaddy makes Office 365 available. 
        <br /><br />
        There are four plans with different resources, to be chosen according to needs. The Essentials plan includes only professional email. The famous programs in the Office suite, such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint are only available in the top two plans, respectively in the online and installed version.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to e-mail and Office programs, the top plans also have 1 TB of cloud storage, via OneDrive. Microsoft Teams, a service that allows the integration of teams through communication and video conferencing programs, is also present in the top two plans and is also a platform differential.
        <br /><br />

    <h3 class="spacez2">Domain registration</h3>

    <p class="spacez">When it comes to domain registration, we can say that GoDaddy has a long tradition. The company is the largest domain registrar in the world, with more than 19 million users of the registration service. With prices that vary according to the length (762 extensions are currently).
        <br /><br />
        Whatever the extension, it is important to pay attention to the price of the renovation. In some cases, the difference between the first year and the renewal is quite large. 
        <br /><br />
        The company also offers complementary services to domain registration, such as the domain privacy protection service, and hides the domain's contact information from the public Whois database. 
        <br /><br />
        There is also the protection and security service for companies, which, in addition to hiding Whois data, also prevents the accidental transfer of the domain and performs regular and automatic checks against malware and other threats.
        <br /><br />


    <h3 class="spacez2">Customer Portal</h3>

    <p class="spacez">GoDaddy has a customer portal through which it is possible to view and manage all contracted products. Through the portal it is also possible to perform various operations, such as DNS pointing, for the contracted domains, accessing the cPanel or the Plesk panel, configuring the automatic renewal of products, among many other operations.
