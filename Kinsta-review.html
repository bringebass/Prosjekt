        Suitable For: Kinsta focuses heavily on offering, mainly suitable for those who’re looking for a large number of different services and plans. Kinsta makes it suitable for many different categories of customers.

        Overall Rating: Very Good
        
        Summary: Kinsta is one of the best-known hosting providers globally and which, especially over the last few years, has stood out from the crowd thanks to the great variety of its offer and its pricing plans.
        </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">What is Kinsta?</h6>
    <p class="spacez">Kinsta is one of the easiest hosting to manage even for beginners, which makes it ideal for all users who want to start working immediately without having to face technical and compatibility problems.

        Kinsta is a company founded in 2013. They are headquartered in the United States greater Los Angeles area, Los Angeles, London, Berlin and Budapest with a team. The company focuses on using the Google Cloud platform to provide reliable WordPress hosting, nothing more. Team members consider themselves developers first, but their goal is to
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="spacez">Make WordPress hosting available to people with non-core technical backgrounds</li>
            <li class="spacez">Get as close as possible to a one-click solution</li>
        </ul>



    <h6 class="spacez2">Who’s Kinsta For?</h6>
    <p class="spacez">Like all hosting providers currently active for WordPress and other CMSs, Kinsta focuses on the variety of its offer, so that it can meet the needs of as many market segments as possible.

        One of its tricks up its sleeve is undoubtedly represented by the fact that it also offers  low cost packages, designed for those who have no particular needs in terms of space and management of access peaks.
        </p>
  
    <h6 class="spacez2">How Does Kinsta Work?</h6>
    <p class="spacez">Dealing with WordPress hosting providers that only provide services built around the WP engine may be different. Kinsta hosting is a company that has gained a lot of attention as a managed WordPress provider in recent years. They provide a platform built on the Google Cloud system, which means that people who need to be always online hosting will have less concern about the normal operation of the data center. Their prices are also in line with many top-notch managed WordPress hosting providers.</p>
  
    <h6 class="spacez2">Features and Plans</h6>
    <p class="spacez">Kinsta has, as we will see, also very interesting offers for the Enterprise sector, obviously at a higher cost.

        Among the plans offered by Kinsta we find:
        
        Starter: at a cost of 30 USD per month, we will have a package that includes an installation on WordPress, the ability to manage up to 20,000 accesses per month and 10 GB of space for your files.
        
        Pros: at a cost of 60 USD, we will have 40,000 monthly visits, 30 GB of storage space and two WordPress installations at our disposal.
        
        Business 1: we are now starting to enter the field of offers for companies: the Business package, available at a price of 100 USD per month, will give us five installations, 30 GB of space and a maximum of visits equal to 100,000 accesses.
        
        Business 2: let's go up again and with this plan, which can be purchased at the figure of 200 USD per month, we will have the ability to manage 10 WordPress sites, counting on a storage space of 40 GB and 250,000 maximum visits.
        
        Business 3: with 300 USD, we will be able to manage 20 sites, have a maximum of 400,000 visits per month and 50 GB of space.
        
        Business 4: By adding another $100, the Business 4 plan offers the ability to manage 40 sites, sustain traffic of 600,000 visits per month and take advantage of 60 GB of space. In all Business packages, Kinsta offers both SSL and CDN for free.
        
        In addition, Kinsta also has a number of plans for businesses, designed to offer top-notch performance even to larger customers:
        
        Enterprise 1: 60 installations, 100,000,000 visits and 100GB of space for the price of $600.
        
        Enterprise 2: 80 manageable WordPress sites, 1,500,000 monthly visits, 150 GB at 900 USD.
        
        Enterprise 3: 120 sites, 2,000,000 visits and 200GB of space for your files for $1,200 per month.
        
        Enterprise 4: 150 sites, 3,000,000 monthly views, 250 GB of space and, also in this case, free SSL and CDN on all packages in this category.
        
        An interesting offer also for business customers, typically looking for decidedly more important machines and services.
        
        Kinsta WordPress hosting: Everything you need to know
        
        Based on what we have just seen, it is particularly interesting for those customers who have particularly important needs in terms of network size, also allowing all customers to choose from as many as 20 Google Cloud Platform data centers and assistance dedicated managed by expert staff on WordPress.
        
        A solution, the one offered by Kinsta, that does not neglect even those customers who have less specific needs, and who perhaps need to learn more about WordPress.
        
        Kinsta focuses heavily on WordPress and certainly could not do otherwise, because we are in front of the most used CMS in the world, as well as on the service on which all the main hosting providers collide with offers.
        
        At Kinsta you will also find  Premium WordPress, 100% managed hosting, suitable for both those with small projects and for those who have to set up portals of important dimensions and with high traffic peaks.
        
        It is worth mentioning at this juncture that Kinsta also offers WordPress  installed and a customer service on the CMS from 8 to 16.
        </p>

    <h6 class="spacez2">Performance</h6>
    <p class="spacez">NEED TO REWRITE</p>
    
      
    <h6 class="spacez2">Assistance and support</h6>
    <p class="spacez">When it comes to support, Kinsta offers a lot but not everything that other high-end providers have in fact accustomed us to.

        It is certainly important, in this regard, to remember that Kinsta customer assistance is also available in Italian, but only in certain specific time slots; the one in English, on the other hand, is active 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, which in any case makes its customer service system highly competitive.
        
        But will all this be enough to declare Kinsta the  best hosting of 2020, whether it's WordPress or some other service?
        
        In our opinion yes
        </p>

      
    <h6 class="spacez2">Advantages of Kinsta Hosting</h6>
    <p class="spacez">
        1) Visit
        
        One of the more interesting things about Kinsta hosting service is the way it handles administrative tasks. As mentioned earlier, the company is proud to be able to complete the management work for you.
        
        Many other hosting companies in the WordPress-only market offer similar services, but they tend to cause some trouble for more advanced users. In other words, if you want more core functions (such as SSH access and the ability to import SSL certificates), most competitors will feel pain or promise for this and then not provide them.
        
        Kinsta hosting actually provides administrative access and keeps it running. Although knowledgeable users who are proficient in programming with PHP 7 are not the company's goal, Kinsta and the support team will not hinder people who want to delve into the guts of their website.
        
        2) Future Proof
        
        The hosting plan has been configured to support the following:
        
        ●	HTTP/2
        ●	Let's encrypt
        ●	virtual machine
        ●	PHP 7
        ●	WP-CLI
        ●	Git
        ●	Periodic running time check
        ●	Daily backup
        
        For people purely as graphic designers or marketers, this may seem like a lot of technical confusion, but in the final analysis your website will be ready for the future. You can also choose the location of the data center so that the site speed can be optimized for the area where most users live. WordPress users are also welcome to connect their site to the content delivery network of their choice.
        
        3) The dashboard
        
        The Kinsta dashboard uses a clean, modern design to make everything within reach. The interface works well in both desktop and mobile environments, and you can keep up with the number of visitors whether you are in the office or on the go. There is even a powerful analysis toolkit to help you determine the booming of your website and what might be better.
        
        4) CDN
        
        The CDN option included when using Kinsta is a godsend. Most of your visits are likely to be in the form of visits to static pages, so there is no need to refresh all the time. More importantly, Kinsta will not count visits to your standard visitor count.
        
        5) Educational resources
        
        Kinsta resources
        
        Although Kinsta is not to let the world free access to its educational resources, but actually a good knowledge base hidden on the site.

        </ul>

        <p class="spacez">
6) Your Staging Site

It's hard to overstate how important it is to have a useful sandbox when doing WordPress development or design. A few adjustments to a line of code or the addition of some WordPress plugins can cause the site to be completely stuck. At the same time, there is no good way to test anything in WP except to start the code, load the browser and see what happens. No one wants their production site to be in an "accidental" mode, which is why it is great that Kinsta uses the staging environment to make this process less hands-on experience.
</p>
      
    <h6 class="spacez2">Disadvantages of Kinsta hosting</h6>
    <p class="spacez"><
        1) No domain name sales
        
        This may seem like a minor issue, but you still have to configure a domain name on a company's account and then connect it to your Kinsta account. It is also a pain to pay close attention to one bill of Kinsta and another bill of the registrant. Fortunately, DNS management is a breeze, so you have at least a relatively easy time to connect to both ends of this problem.
        
        2) Uptime
        
        Kanista's uptime does not make it the best WordPress hosting option in its class. Although the speed test provided it with good responsiveness, the uptime in the worst month was less than 99.8%. Most WordPress users want to see close to 99.99%. The downtime may be short, but it is recommended that you pay close attention to it in the dashboard and use your own external monitoring tools.
        
        Mixed Bag Items
        
        1) Those who migrate freely
        
        Kinsta did not hide the facts, but also did not make it clear that they only provide free site migration from the list of specific hosting companies. You may need to pay attention to "read beautiful text". If you are dealing with issues like WordPress sites on independently hosted servers, the migration process will be more of a problem for you compared to some other companies.
        
        You can only perform site migration once on the minimum account. At the $30 level, you can only migrate once a year.
        
        2) Number of visitors
        
        There are not many visitors to the 20,000 smallest package. Even if you make the most of the content delivery network and cache plug-ins, you will be shocked at how quickly these numbers are swallowed. However, it is easy to upgrade the scalability of your plan, but be prepared to pay.
        
        3) Integration
        
        If each plan provides e-commerce, the item will appear in the "Professional" section. Unfortunately, some smaller hosting plans do not integrate certain plugins out of the box, such as Woocommerce.

<h6 class="spacez2">Conclusions</h6>
<p class="spacez">
    It is easy to understand why Kinsta has become the darling of agency, marketing and design. This is a hosting solution supported by WordPress experts, which makes users feel that there is no need to network or walk a tightrope. Whether you are building a new site or handling the migration process, the MyKinsta dashboard is designed to make the whole process as simple as possible.
    
    Pricing may make Kinsta hosting cease to be the first choice of coders, programmers and developers. In other words, for the tech-savvy people of Kinsta management. If you really need to ask a staff member or freelancer to help you, don’t feel embarrassed. In fact, the tools Kinsta also provides them will surprise them.
    
    The response time is very good, although the uptime may be better.
    
    For those who need the obviously best WordPress hosting, a WordPress site managed by Kinsta may not be the absolute first choice, but it is still a good value proposition for anyone who has no time to speed up coding and add-ons and server-level sysadmin.

                    <p>Thewebsitecentral.com provides professional web services reviews fully independent of any other entity. Our assessments of the service providers are fair and balanced, and we only recommend service providers that we believe provide the most value to our readers. While compensation is sometimes received from some of the companies listed on this site (when links are used to make a purchase), service providers can not pay to change or eliminate our reviews.</p> 
                </br>
                        <p>In addition, the prices and services posted in our reviews are changed by the service providers on a frequent basis. Thewebsitecentral.com is regularly updating the reviews, but are not always informed by the service providers of changes in their services and can therefore not guarantee that the information is 100% accurate at any given time. Therefore, all readers must always consult the service provider’s web pages for the most updated information regarding their respective service offerings.</p>
