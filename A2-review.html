    <h2 class="headline6">Introduction</h2>

    
    <h3 class="spacez2">Summary</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">
        A2 Hosting is one of the best hosting service providers we have found. The company has a particular focus on speed and provided exceptional response time for websites on its servers. In addition, A2 hosting has the most essential functionalities, and all of this is offered at a low to medium price compared to the other players in the industry.
        </p>
    
        
    <h3 class="spacez2">What is A2 hosting?</h3>
    <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting, founded by Bryan Muthig in 2003 is one of the most popular and widespread web hosting services in the world. The company has been in the market for almost two decades, thus establishing itself as one of the longest-lived companies in the hosting industry. Throw-out the years, A2 Hosting has maintained its popularity, and its servers are some of the fastest we've ever seen. 
        
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="spacez2">Who is A2 hosting for?</h3>
    <p class="spacez">

        A2 Hosting is a hosting service provider that are suitable for private individuals, small and large business. That said, the company has a particular focus on server speed, and is therefore ideal for anyone who needs a particularly fast loading web site.
<br/> <br/>

A2 Hosting is a popular hosting provider and a supplier to be taken into consideration if you intend to use a solid, efficient, and affordable service for everyone, especially in terms of price. 



        </p>
    
    
    <h2 class="headline6">A2 Hosting Features </h2>
    

    <h3 class="spacez2">1.	Speed</h3>
    
    
    <p class="spacez">At times, the insistence of the importance of the speed of a server can seem long-winded and exaggerated. However, for your web site to deliver the best user experience, and have a good SEO standing, speed is one of the most important factors to think about. A2 Hosting provides one of the highest ranked services on this point. Response times is also an important factor to consider. The site claims that the service can make your site "frighteningly fast", and its subscriptions are all categorized according to the speed offered, taking distinctive names like Swift and Turbo. <br/> <br/>Before labeling a hosting service as "the fastest" in such a competitive field as the hosting market, you have to do the necessary tests. The response time we measured range from 278ms to 420ms in the last 12 months, which Is among the fastest we have tracked. For the most part, they were around 280ms, which is an excellent rate by any comparison. Remember that the distance to server location is important here, however it seems fair to state that speed is one of the strongest points with A2 Hosting.
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="spacez2">2. Uptime</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">
        Uptime is probably the second most important feature of a hosting service, as your site will always need to be reachable by visitors and customers. Typically, website owners want hosting that guarantees 99.95 to 100% uptime. Most of the time, the A2 fits perfectly into this range, and has never dropped below 99.99% in the last 6 months. However, in August 2020, the average was 99.95% and in the previous two months, 99.70% (June) and 99.85% (July), which are quite fair numbers. Despite this, A2 hosting has proceeded without too many hitches from that point on, and as already mentioned its annual average is around 99.93% uptime, perfectly in line with the industry average.<br/> <br/>
        
        The company has a 99.9% uptime “commitment”, which means the company: “…will provide a service credit in the amount of 5% of paid fee for the month, for every hour that your website is unreachable due to an internal network or equipment failure.” It is a good sign that A2 Hosting is putting its money behind its uptime-ambitions.
        </p>
  

            <h3 class="spacez2">3. Customer Service</h3>


            <p class="spacez">
                Customer support is another determining factor in choosing a hosting service. It is important to have a team that can support you in case of difficulty. If you need to solve a problem but cannot do it yourself (and sooner or later it will happen), you will need a team that is available, and can help you quickly and efficiently. If you to speak to one of their operators, you can easily contact them by phone, chat, or with the ticket system. In our test, the staff will be very friendly, efficient, and quick to help you. 
                
                <br/> <br/>Basically, we consider A2's customer support to be particularly good, despite the slightly slow response time, on some of the more complex questions. In addition, A2 hosting makes hundreds of articles available in its database. This will help you find a solution for any problem you may run into; in case you want to fix it yourself.
                
                 </p>

            <h3 class="spacez2">4. Plans and Prices</h3>


            <p class="spacez">Another aspect to consider when choosing a hosting service is the price. This does not come as a surprise, and you will surely know that in launching a new online business it is important to find the best conditions, to ensure that the expenses do not become unsustainable before the business has even started.</p>

            <h4 class="spacez2">A2 Hosting shared hosting price and subscriptions</h4>


            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting’s shared plans are offered in four different plans:</p>


            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Startup Plan - $2.99 per month (promotional price), including support for one website, five databases, free SSL, cPanel, memory and unlimited bandwidth.</li>
                <li class="spacez">Drive Plan - $4.99 per month (promotional price), including one website migration, unlimited sites, memory, bandwidth, and database with no restrictions of any kind, SSL certificate and cPanel</li>
                <li class="spacez">Turbo Boost - $9.99 per month (promotional price), for which you get everything included in the Lite and Swift plan, plus the A2 Site Accelerator, and speeds 20x faster.</li>
                <li class="spacez">Turbo Max - $14.99 per month (promotional price), for which you get everything included in the Lite and Swift plan, plus the A2 Site Accelerator, and speeds 20x faster AND a large increase of hardware resources (esp. physical memory and CPU cores).</li>
            </ul>





            <h3 class="spacez2">5. Renewal Conditions</h3>
      
            <p class="spacez">The review of A2, so far, has highlighted positive aspects. However, like every service, this host also has its weaknesses, and renewal conditions are part of them. The prices are quite affordable. However, if you choose a long-term plan, the prices will be significantly reduced. Basically, by opting for the three-year plan instead of the monthly one, the price would be much cheaper than a three-year period paid month by month. The service also includes a discount for new customers, which essentially reduces the price by almost 50%. However, once the terms of the contract have expired, it will not be possible to benefit from the same discounts again, and the price to be paid would be almost double. You will find this strange pricing structure in many other similar web hosting services, as this strategy has proven effective in attracting customers. By leveraging user satisfaction, hosting services focus on the fact that the customer himself wants to continue using the service avoiding the hassle of migration, thus preferring to pay a higher price. In any case, if you decide to migrate your website before the price increase, you may have to deal with a usually hidden clause, which requires a written notice for cancellation at least 15 days in advance of the deadline contract. If you miss this deadline, you will be charged for the renewal, with no refund. This is something you should be aware of.

            </p>


            <h3 class="spacez2">6. Money Back Guarantee</h3>
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting’s money-back guarantee allows you to terminate your relationship with the service if you notice any problems during the trial period (begins at the time of purchase). That said, in recent years, A2 Hosting has introduced changes that benefit users: the refund guarantee has been extended to an "indefinite" period of time , which gives you the right to request a refund even after one year, if you are not satisfied with the service. However, the mechanism should be specified. If you sign a three-year contract, and you find yourself requesting a refund at the end of the first, the provider would return you an amount of money equal to the payment of the remaining two years of the contract. Obviously, some conditions must be specified. For example, any refunds requested after the first 120 days would be issued through PayPal. And in any case, the refund policy only applies to expenses related to the selected plan. All extras, starting from the migration fees, to the domain registration fees and the like, remain non-refundable. But even under these conditions, the customer-friendly approach remains a virtually unique feature in the industry.

                 </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">7. Limited Economic Plans</h3>
            <p class="spacez">One feature of this provider that did not leave us particularly enthusiastic is the offer included in the cheapest plans. We have noted that the subscriptions live up to their promises, being available from just $2.99. This remains cheap compared to the competitors. That said, for such an affordable price you get a limited package, at least when compared to the competition's offers. The Startup plan only includes one website. You will have unlimited storage, yes, as well as free SSL certificate, website migration and the aforementioned “unlimited” money back guarantee. But you will not have access to many of the features that make the A2 a great choice, such as the 20x speed of the Turbo plans. The same applies to their website builder offer: the cheapest is in fact just $4 a month, the price for which you will only get a single page. In other words, if you are thinking of buying the cheapest plans, you should know the limitations.
                
                 </p>

          
            <h3 class="spacez2">9. Security</h3>
          
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting has an emphasis on making your site secure. Its servers are protected by a service called HackScan, which guarantees 24/7 monitoring aimed at identifying malware and potentially harmful traffic to servers or websites. Even in the field of hackers and hackers, prevention is better than cure, and A2 Hosting seems determined not to find the side of the ill-intentioned. This will allow you and your customers to rest assured.
                
                </p>
            <h2 class="spacez2">Other A2 Hosting plans</h2>
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting, as we see from its official website, offers different categories of products, each of which is divided within it into various packages:</p>


  <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Web Hosting: A series of packages that allow you to manage your site in complete autonomy, starting from about 3 USD per month up to a maximum of 9.32 USD for the Turbo package, which is the most complete at internal of this category.</li>
                <li class="spacez">WordPress Hosting: A series of interesting packages dedicated to the management of the most popular CMS in the world, always calibrated according to the different needs of the industry.</li>
                <li class="spacez">VPS Hosting: Section divided in turn into three main plans, so that customers can choose the one that best suits their needs: Core, Managed and Unmanaged.</li>
            </ul>

          


            <h2 class="spacez2">WordPress Hosting</h2>

            <p class="spacez">
                As for the services offered by A2 Hosting for WordPress, there are four different options to choose from:
                 </p>

                 <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Startup Plan - $2.99 per month (promotional price), including support for one website, five databases, free SSL, cPanel, memory and unlimited bandwidth.</li>
                    <li class="spacez">
                        Drive Plan - $4.99 per month (promotional price), including one website migration, unlimited sites, memory, bandwidth, and database with no restrictions of any kind, SSL certificate and cPanel.
                        </li>
                        
                    <li class="spacez">
                        Turbo Boost - $9.99 per month (promotional price), for which you get everything included in the Lite and Swift plan, plus the A2 Site Accelerator, and speeds 20x faster.
                           </li>
                    <li class="spacez">Turbo Max - $14.99 per month (promotional price), for which you get everything included in the Lite and Swift plan, plus the A2 Site Accelerator, and speeds 20x faster AND a large increase of hardware resources (esp. physical memory and CPU cores).</li>


                </ul>

            <p class="spacez">It is a question, as can be seen from what has just been said, that A2 focuses a lot on both the price and the quality of the services offered - a commercially very sensible move, especially if we consider that as regards the management of WordPress, the competition in the sector has become recent really ruthless.</p>

            <h2 class="spacez2">Dedicated hosting</h2>
            <p class="spacez">Furthermore, A2 Hosting offers very interesting packages also with regard to dedicated hosting:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Unmanaged Server: Starting at $99.59, we will have a server solution that guarantees 99.9% uptime and the ability to choose the operating system we prefer.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    SSD Server: Fully managed solutions for which we will also have dedicated assistance active 24/7, at the starting price of 129.30 USD.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    Managed Flex: A 100% fully managed solution, one of the most complete and interesting in this category, at a price of 141.09 USD per month.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    Core Flex: Perfect solutions for enterprise customers, with very high quality services and features including root access and a very attractive price of 141.09 USD per month - the same as the Managed offer.</li>
            </ul>



            <h2 class="spacez2">A2 Hosting VPS server</h2>
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting, also in this case, offers its customers three possibilities to choose from, continuing as for the other categories of services offered to present itself as a provider with essential but very valid services:</p>


            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Unmanaged VPS: from $5 per month, an essential package with a Linux operating system and a guaranteed uptime of 99.9%;</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                   
Managed VPS: this option allows you to access your server through a dedicated control panel, at a price of 25USD per month;
</li>
                <li class="spacez">
              
Core VPS: an even more complete and important solution, suitable for those who have storage needs of a certain size and certainly very valid also from a technical point of view.
</li>
            </ul>





            <h2 class="spacez2">Performance</h2>
            <p class="spacez">In general, after having explained the services offered by A2 Hosting, we can conclude that they are able to provide its customers with valid and efficient services. A2 hosting is in line with the prices that we currently find on the market. In addition to that, the speed you can receive with some of the A2 Hosting plans are among the industry leading ones.

            <p class="spacez">
                We recommend A2 Hosting due to that the service offers truly incredible speed, is relatively inexpensive, and has the essential functionalities that make A2 Hosting an excellent choice for anyone who wants to launch their own website. Potential users should be aware that the cancellation clause is active until 15 days in advance of the effective date. The cheaper plans are also quite limited, but this should be evaluated according to your needs. In any case, the "unlimited" guarantee for reimbursement is an offer that provides us consumers with some added flexibility. An all-round great hosting company.
