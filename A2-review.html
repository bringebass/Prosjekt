        A2 Hosting is certainly one of the most popular hosting providers and, consequently, a supplier to be taken into great consideration if we intend to use a solid, efficient and affordable service for everyone, even in terms cheap. 


    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">OVERALL RATING:</h6>
    
    <p class="spacez">Very good
        </p>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">SUMMARY: </h6>
    
    <p class="spacez">
        A2Hosting is undoubtedly a high-level solution, both from the point of view of the variety of its offer and from the point of view of the quality of the services it offers to its customers.

        In fact, it is a provider able to offer products that can adapt to the needs of both large companies and individuals who, perhaps, intend to manage their personal website without spending large amounts.
        </p>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">What is A2Hosting?</h6>
        
    
    <p class="spacez">A2Hosting, Founded by Bryan Muthig in 2003 is one of the most popular and widespread web hosting services in the world.

        To date, A2 Hosting is a service that boasts an excellent resume. In fact, it has been on the market for almost two decades, thus establishing itself as one of the longest-lived options in its specific sector. In the years, A2 Hosting has maintained its popularity, and its servers are some of the fastest we've ever seen.
        
        Not to mention that speed is one of the flagship features of this service.
        
        
        </p>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">Who is A2Hosting For?</h6>
    
    <p class="spacez">

        A2 Hosting is a company for those who don't need compalaction, as A2 Hosting offers hosting services through basic tools that outperform any other web hosting server in quality.  Picking A2 Hosting ensures a quick connection at reasonable costs.
        </p>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">How does A2Hosting Work?</h6>
    
    <p class="spacez">It allows you to perform actions such as creating profiles, protecting files on the server, installing applications and viewing statistics in seconds. It stands out for its customer assistance, with various forms of contact to be assisted by one of the technicians who are available 24 hours a day, every day of the year.</p>

    <!--Fortsett her-->
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">A2Hosting Features: </h6>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">1.	Speed</h6>
    
    
    <p class="spacez">At times, our insistence on the importance of the speed of a server can seem long-winded, and a tad exaggerated. However, A2Hosting has all the good reasons for beating on this point.

        Response times will be a fairly recurring theme, and visiting the A2 Hosting site, you will realize how much the service itself is keen to let you know the data on the speed offered.
        
        The site claims that the service can make your site "frighteningly fast", and its subscriptions are all categorized according to the speed offered, taking distinctive names like Swift and Turbo.
        
        Now, before labeling a hosting service as "the fastest" in such a competitive market, you have to do the necessary checks. But A2 Hosting has everything it takes to deserve this title.
        
        The times measured range from 278ms to 420ms in the last 12 months. But, for the most part, they were around 280ms, certainly an excellent reading.
        
        In other words, speed is a big plus for A2 hosting.
        </p>
    
    <h6 class="spacez2">2. Uptime</h6>
    
    <p class="spacez">
        Uptime is probably the second most important feature of a hosting service, as your site will need to be reachable by visitors and customers at all times. Unfortunately, the A2 does not repeat its success in terms of speed, while managing to offer a relatively good uptime.

        Typically, website owners want hosting that guarantees 99.95 to 100% uptime. Most of the time, the A2 fits perfectly into this range, and has never dropped below 99.99% in the last 6 months. However, in August 2019, the average was 99.95% and in the previous two months, 99.70% (June) and 99.85% (July), not excellent figures.
        
        Despite this, A2 hosting has proceeded without too many hitches from that point on, and as already mentioned its annual average is around 99.93% uptime, perfectly in line with the industry average, although the metric itself.
        

        </p>
  

            <h6 class="spacez2">3. Customer Service</h6>


            <p class="spacez">Customer support is another determining factor in choosing a hosting service. It is indeed important to have a team that can support you in case of difficulty.

                If you need to solve a more or less big problem but can't do it (and sooner or later it will happen), you will need a team that can help you quickly and efficiently. 
                
                Many services seem not to be aware of it, but fortunately A2 Hosting is not among them. This hosting provider makes hundreds of articles available in its database. This will help you find a solution for any problem you may run into, in case you want to fix it yourself.

                Alternatively, if you prefer to speak to one of their operators, you can easily contact them by phone, chat, or with the ticket system. Once you get in touch with an operator, the staff will be very friendly, efficient and quick to help you.
                
                Basically, we consider A2's customer support to be very good, despite the slightly slow response time.
                
                 </p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">4. Plans and Prices</h6>


            <p class="spacez">Another aspect to consider when choosing a hosting service is the price. This does not come as a surprise, and you will surely know that in launching a new online business it is important to find the best conditions, to ensure that the expenses do not become unsustainable before the business has even started.</p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">A2 Hosting Price and subscriptions</h6>


            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting's offers are quite generous. The plans offered are three, divided into:</p>


            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Lite Plan - $3.92 per month, including support for one website, five databases, free SSL, cPanel, memory and unlimited bandwidth.</li>
                <li class="spacez">Swift Plan - $4.90 per month, including one website migration, unlimited sites, memory, bandwidth and database with no restrictions of any kind, SSL certificate and cPanel</li>
                <li class="spacez">Turbo Plan - $9.31 per month, for which you get everything included in the Lite and Swift plan, plus the A2 Site Accelerator, and speeds 20x faster.</li>
            </ul>





            <h6 class="spacez2">5. Renewal Conditions</h6>
      
            <p class="spacez">The review of A2, so far has highlighted positive aspects. However, like every service, this host also has its weaknesses, and renewal conditions are part of them.

                The prices are quite affordable. However, if you choose a long-term plan, the prices will be significantly reduced.
                
                Basically, by opting for the three-year plan instead of the monthly one, the price would be much cheaper than a three-year period paid month by month. The service also includes a discount for new customers, which essentially reduces the price by almost 50%.
                
                However, once the terms of the contract have expired, it will not be possible to benefit from the same discounts again, and the price to be paid would be almost double. You will find this strange pricing structure in many other similar web hosting services, as this strategy has proven effective in attracting customers.
                
                By leveraging user satisfaction, hosting services focus on the fact that the customer himself wants to continue using the service avoiding the hassle of migration, thus preferring to pay a higher price.
                
                In any case, if you decide to migrate your website before the price increase, you may have to deal with a usually hidden clause, which requires a written notice for cancellation at least 15 days in advance of the deadline contract. If you miss this deadline, you will be charged for the renewal, with no refund.</p>


            <h6 class="spacez2">6. Money Back Guarantee</h6>
            <p class="spacez">Staying on the subject of subscriptions and payments, if briefly talk about the satisfaction-or-refund guarantee offered by A2 Hosting. This Warranty has an unlimited extension unlike what happens with other web hosting.

                The money-back guarantee allows you to terminate your relationship with the service if you notice any problems during the trial period, which begins at the time of purchase. That said, in recent years, A2 Hosting has introduced changes that benefit users.

To date, the refund guarantee has been extended to an "indefinite" period of time , which gives you the right to request a refund even after one year, if you are not satisfied with the service.

However, the mechanism should be specified. If you sign a three-year contract, and you find yourself requesting a refund at the end of the first, the provider would return you an amount of money equal to the payment of the remaining two years of the contract.

Obviously, some conditions must be specified. For example, any refunds requested after the first 120 days would be issued through PayPal. And in any case, the refund policy only applies to expenses related to the selected plan. All extras, starting from the migration fees, to the domain registration fees and the like, remain non-refundable.

But even under these conditions, the customer-friendly approach remains a virtually unique feature in the industry.

                 </p>
            <h6 class="spacez2">7. Limited Economic Plans</h6>
            <p class="spacez">One feature of this provider that didn't leave us particularly enthusiastic is the offer included in the cheapest plans. We've noted that the aforementioned subscriptions live up to their promises, being available from just $2.96. While this isn't the lowest price seen in this industry, it still remains pretty cheap.

                In any case, for such an affordable price, you won't get much in return, at least when compared to the competition's offers. The Lite plan only includes one website.
                
                You will have unlimited storage, yes, as well as free SSL protocol, website migration and the aforementioned “unlimited” money back guarantee.
                
                But, you won't have access to many of the features that make the A2 a great choice, such as the 20x speed of the Turbo plan.
                
                The same applies to their website builder offer: the cheapest is in fact just $4 a month, the price for which you will only get a single page.
                
                In other words, if you are thinking of buying the cheapest plans, you should know the limitations.
                
                 </p>

          
            <h6 class="spacez2">9. Free Security</h6>
          
            <p class="spacez">The internet is a far from safe place these days. And people are taking notice. This is why you should limit your exposure to secure websites and offer a portal that is committed to guaranteeing it to its users. And the same goes for your hosting provider.

                A2 Hosting Makes your site secure
                
                A2's work in this regard is truly excellent. Its servers are protected by a service called HackScan, which guarantees 24/7 monitoring aimed at identifying malware and potentially harmful traffic to servers or websites.
                
                Even in the field of hackers and hackers, prevention is better than cure, and A2 Hosting seems determined not to find the side of the ill-intentioned. This will allow you and your customers to rest assured.
                
                </p>
            <h6 class="spacez2">A2Hosting plans</h6>
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting, as we see from its official website, offers different categories of products, each of which is divided within it into various packages and formulas:</p>


  <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Web Hosting: A series of packages that allow you to manage your site in complete autonomy, starting from just over 3 USD per month up to a maximum of 9.32 USD for the Turbo package, which is the most complete at internal of this category.</li>
                <li class="spacez">VPS Hosting: Section divided in turn into three main categories, so that customers can choose the one that best suits their needs: Core, Managed and Unmanaged.</li>
                <li class="spacez">WordPress Hosting: A series of very interesting packages dedicated to the management of the most popular CMS in the world, always calibrated according to the different needs of the industry.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="spacez">A provider, therefore, not only able to offer tailor-made and fully customizable packages, but also relatively cheap and therefore within everyone's reach.</p>


            <h6 class="spacez2">WordPress Hosting</h6>

            <p class="spacez">
        As for the services offered by A2 Hosting for WordPress, we mainly have three different options to choose from, each of which adapts, as we will see, to the type of business we intend to manage:
                 </p>

                 <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Lite: 1 site, SSL certificate and unlimited data transfer for only 3.92 USD per month;</li>
                    <li class="spacez">
                        Turbo: Unlimited traffic, flat data transfer, SSL certificate and migration of your eventual site for only 9.31 USD per month.
                        </li>
                </ul>

            <p class="spacez">It is a question, as can be seen from what has just been said, that A2 focuses a lot on both the price and the quality of the services offered - a commercially very sensible move, especially if we consider that as regards the management of WordPress, the competition in the sector has become recent really ruthless.</p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">Dedicated hosting</h6>
            <p class="spacez">Furthermore, A2 Hosting offers very interesting packages also with regard to dedicated hosting:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Unmanaged Server: Starting at $99.59, we will have a server solution that guarantees 99.9% uptime and the ability to choose the operating system we prefer.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    SSD Server: Fully managed solutions for which we will also have dedicated assistance active 24/7, at the starting price of 129.30 USD.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    Managed Flex: A 100% fully managed solution, one of the most complete and interesting in this category, at a price of 141.09 USD per month.</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                    Core Flex: Perfect solutions for enterprise customers, with very high quality services and features including root access and a very attractive price of 141.09 USD per month - the same as the Managed offer.</li>
            </ul>



            <h6 class="spacez2">A2Hosting VPS server</h6>
            <p class="spacez">A2 Hosting, also in this case, offers its customers three possibilities to choose from, continuing as for the other categories of services offered to present itself as a provider with essential but very valid services:</p>


            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Unmanaged VPS: from $5 per month, an essential package with a Linux operating system and a guaranteed uptime of 99.9%;</li>
                <li class="spacez">
                   
Managed VPS: this option allows you to access your server through a dedicated control panel, at a price of 25USD per month;
</li>
                <li class="spacez">
              
Core VPS: an even more complete and important solution, suitable for those who have storage needs of a certain size and certainly very valid also from a technical point of view.
</li>
            </ul>





            <h6 class="spacez2">Performance</h6>
            <p class="spacez">In general, after having explained the services offered by A2 Hosting, we can conclude that it is a provider that is undoubtedly able to provide its customers with valid, efficient and in line with the prices that, in principle, we currently find on the market.
                </p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">Assistance and Support</h6>
    
            <p class="spacez">In this case we are talking about excellence: A2 Hosting in fact offers its customers a customer care service active 24/7 practically standard, or offered together with all the packages that we can buy, from the cheapest to those designed for business use.</p>

    

            <h6 class="spacez2">Does A2hosting offer cPanel?</h6>
            <p class="spacez">Yes. It is also possible to integrate the cPanel service into your hosting solutions chosen from A2hosting.

                We are talking about one of the most performing panels in the world of space and website management, which allows you to have all the most important settings and management software for managing your website at your fingertips.
                
                We are facing a hosting that therefore offers what for many is really the  minimum wage, a software without which it would not even be necessary to talk about hosting.
                </p>

       

            <h6 class="spacez2">Why we like A2hosting: Our Opinion</h6>

            <p class="spacez">
                We think it is a really good service, even if on average more expensive than market competitors.
                
                Those who are looking for an important service and do not have  any kind of budget problem might really think they can buy a space (or perhaps one of the additional services) of the provider in question.
                </p>
            <h6 class="spacez2">A2 Hosting vs Siteground: The Differences</h6>
            <p class="spacez">How does A2 Hosting behave if we compare it to what Siteground offers, which is the provider we believe to be the most competitive at the moment.

                Of course, we repeat it, by choosing A2 Hosting as we can be sure of counting on an efficient and performing service, but A2 are still far from the levels of quality and performance to which Siteground has now accustomed.
                
                </p>
            <h6 class="spacez2">Prices</h6>
            <p class="spacez">In terms of prices, it still presents itself today as the supplier able to offer the best packages at the lowest prices on the market, which complicates the life of its competitors and, in an increasingly globalized way.
                </p>

            <h6 class="spacez2">Pros and cons of A2 Hosting</h6>
            <h6 class="spacez2">PROS</h6>
            

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Servers up to 20x faster</li>

            <h6 class="spacez2">CONS</h6>
            
            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Turbo Server plan a little expensive</li>
                <li class="spacez">High renewal price</li>
            </ul>

            <h6 class="spacez2">Conclusion</h6>
            <p class="spacez">Basically, do we recommend A2?</p>
   
      
            <p class="spacez">Yes definitely.

                The service offers truly incredible speed, relatively inexpensive, and has numerous other benefits that make  A2 Hosting an excellent choice for anyone who wants to launch their own website.
                
                That said, there are also some details already mentioned that didn't thrill us, such as doubling the price when the first contract expires.
                
                Combined with the cancellation clause at least 15 days in advance of the effective date, it could be a little misleading, so remember this peculiarity. The cheaper plans are also quite limited, but this should be evaluated according to your needs.
                
                In any case, the "unlimited" guarantee for reimbursement is a truly unique detail, which almost "fills" the ambiguity of renewal practices. Basically, the decision is up to you.
