    <h2 class="headline6">Introduction</h2>


<h3 class="spacez2">Summary</h3>

<p class="spacez">
    


    Our assessment of HostGator is meant for private individuals and small to medium sized businesses. That said, even though we do not cover this segment in our assessment, Hostgator also serves larger clients with dedicated servers or cloud solutions.

</p>



<h3 class="spacez2">What is HostGator?</h3>

<p class="spacez">HostGator was founded in 2002 and has become one of the 10 largest and most known names in the hosting industry. is one of the world's top 10 largest web hosting companies, with over 8,000,000 hosted domains. The company is based in Huston, Texas (US) and has over 850 employees. The company was sold by its founder in 2012, and is currently owned by Endurance International Group, which also owns known hosting brands as BlueHost, FatCow, and domain.com
    </p>

<h2 class="headline6">HostGator Features</h2>


<h3 class="spacez2">Plans</h3>

<p class="spacez">

    HostGator offers the lowest promotion prices we have seen, however, you’ll have to commit to a plan for 12 months to receive these low rates (generally 60% off). That stated, the renewal rates you’ll have to pay afterwards are among the lowest that we have identified. Please note that the promotional prices do not include VAT.
<br/><br/>
    In addition, HostGator throws in 100 USD for both Google Ads and Bing Ads (NB! this requires you to spend 25 USD with Google before claiming the credit, and it is a requirement that you have not already signed up a google Adwords account before)
    <br/><br/>
    Although HostGator’s more expensive plans (mostly for larger business needs) are priced closer to other competitors, the cheaper and mid-range plans are generally among the most affordable in the market. Another upside for these plans are that you don't need to sign a contract, which means you can cancel the service without extra charge.
    

    </p>


<h3 class="spacez2">Storage / CPU </h3>



<p class="spacez">HostGator describes storage capacity and CPU use as “unlimited” for its standard shared hosting plans - which is only within limits. GostGator states in their terms: “-we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and to only utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website”. 
    <br/><br/>
    The normal operation limits of disk space and bandwidth is not specified on their web site, but customer support tells me it should hold 7,000 - 8,000 visitors / day. This limit should be adequate for the large majority of personal and small business sites. If your site were close to exceed these undisclosed limits you will receive an email “asking you to reduce usage” or the website will be suspended (temporarily stopped). 
    <br/><br/>
    If higher performance is needed, you easily can upgrade to a fully managed VPS plan or dedicated server, which require 24 to 48 hour of migration, but is easy and more scalable than the shared hosting plans. If you are considering using the HostGator hosting plan - this page will tell you how many visitors you can expect to support (note that the stats are based on the average web page): Are There Traffic Limits on My Website? 
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Bandwith</h3>

<p class="spacez">HostGator describes the plans storage capacity and CPU use as “unmetered” (unlimited) for the shared hosting plans. However, similar to “Storage / _CPU” above, this is within the limits expected of normal operations, which should be adequate for the vast majority of blogs and small commercial sites. If you are approaching this limit, you will get a notification and will be able to upgrade to a larger plan. </p>


<h3 class="spacez2">Scalability</h3>

    <p class="spacez">In case you receive more visitors to your site than what you originally estimated, and are in jeopardy of reaching the monthly limit (e.g. for bandwidth or storage), then HostGator enables you to upgrade your plan at the click of a button in cPanel. This is a needed functionality if you’re very uncertain of the likely.</p>



<h3 class="spacez2">Stability</h3>

    <p class="spacez">All shared web hosting plans include a 45-day money-back and 99.9% uptime guarantees, which is great although quite standard among serious hosting vendors.</p>


<h3 class="spacez2">User-Friendliness </h3>

<p class="spacez">cPanel is standard for HostGator, and is a convenient interface to govern many aspects of your website. 
    <br/><br/>
    The quickInstall tool, available on all web hosting plans, you can create many types of website: blog, forum, CMS, wiki, photo gallery, E-commerce store, and so much more.
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Functionalities</h3>



<p class="spacez">HostGator provides standard functionalities for their cheapest plans. These are one click WordPress installs, free SSL certificate, free Domain
    <br/><br/>
    Hostgator also provides a website builder with 100s of templates, which makes it easy to set up the foundational structure of the page, freeing up more time for content creation. HostGator has free migration support in case you like to move your site from another hosting provider.
    <br/><br/>
    In sum, the amount and quality of functionalities are good, although not extraordinary.  
    
    </p>

<h3 class="spacez2">Support</h3>

<p class="spacez">

    Availability: The company provides 24/7/365 support by telephone, live chat and e-mail for all enquiries which is market leading
    <br/><br/>
    Language: HostGator has support in English, Spanish, Portugese, Chinese, Turkish, Indonesean
    <br/><br/>
    Test: We have tested the only support chat, with some in-depth questions. After we posted our question it took 2 minutes for the customer advisor to be connected. After that it took 4 minutes for the advisor to come back with a relevant answer - which seems to be quite adequate. 
    <br/><br/>
    It's worth stating that the advisor and myself got disconnected due to a glitch in their system, however, another advisor was immediately allocated and picked up the thread with my followup questions. 
    <br/><br/>
    For most of the questions, the advisor gave fast adequate answers - however, for one of the more technical questions it took about 30 mins for them to come back with an answer. Therefore, we will not give.
    

    </p>







<h2 class="headline6">Pros and cons</h2>

<h3 class="spacez2">Pros</h3>

    <ul>
        <li class="spacez">Price (on 12+ months sign up) is among the lowest in the industry</li>
        <li class="spacez">24/7 support in many languages is industry leading access</li>
        <li class="spacez">Easy website builder enables you to set up your website fast and intuitive way  </li>
        <li class="spacez">Many website templates </li>
        <li class="spacez">45 days money back guarantee </li>
        <li class="spacez">Free SSL certificate </li>

       
    </ul>

    <h3 class="spacez2">Cons</h2>

    <p class="spacez">As mentioned earlier, there are drawbacks to every hosting service on this planet. Here are the ones concerning HostGator:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="spacez"> Low pricing is only promotional. That means if you dont want to sign up for 12 months or more, then the price will be higher, although still amonth the lower in the industry. </li>
        <li class="spacez"> You do not get a free domain when signing up for HostGators services. That stated, it is quite normal to provide this for a fee. </li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="headline6">Conclusion</h2>
      
    <p class="spacez">
        HostGator is an allround great service-provider, and delivers one of the best value for money in the business (if you are able to sign up for a plan and commit for a longer time). We belive you will have access to a wide range of essential features, a fully developmed web site builder with many templates, and at the same time pay a fairly low price.
