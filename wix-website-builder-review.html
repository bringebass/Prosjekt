<h2 class="headline6">Getting started</h2>


<h3 class="spacez2">Sign up</h3>

<p class="spacez">
    Signing up for Wix is easy, and maybe more importantly, it is free. As long as you provide your email address and choose a password, and you are good to go. Alternatively, you can choose to sign in through Facebook or Google. You have to be at least thirteen years of age to sign up, or sixteen if you live within the European Union. 
</p>




    <h3 class="spacez2">Templates</h3>
    <p class="spacez">When you initate the wix website builder you get asked what type of website you want to create, and you get to choose between the following twelve categories: business, designer, blog, online store, restaurants and food, beauty and wellness, photography, fitness, portofolio and CV, music, events or “other”.  Based on your choice, Wix presents you with a series of templates suitable for the specific category you chose. When we decided to build a fitness site with wix, we got presented with 49 different templates for this. The absolute majority of these templates had great design and contained a lot of the content and functionalities that you are looking for when building a website. Among other things, you would find social media buttons, navigation bars, chat-bubbles, and background images. The templates provide a great starting point for your website creation.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="spacez2">Wix ADI</h3>


    <p class="spacez">
        Wix has added a really neat feature to their website builder called Wix ADI. Wix ADI is service where artificial intelligence is used to help you create a website. Through answering a series of questions about what website you want, WIX ADI actually goes ahead and creates a website for you on its own. Say you want a website for your restaurant, Wix ADI would then ask you questions like “What do you need on your new website”, or “choose a theme you like”. Having completed all the questions (or in fact, the ones you wish to answer) Wix ADI brings up a whole website for you. We have certainly never seen an easier way to create a website! Admittedly, you probably need to make some changes to the website that are created for you, but ADI does a big part of the job.</p>

    <h2 class="headline6">Building your website</h2>

    
   <h3 class="spacez2">User interface</h3>

    <p class="spacez">Whether you decided to use Wix ADI or just choose a template of your own, the user interface for making changes to your website is the same. It is a graphical interface easily understood by everyone with basic computer knowledge. A bunch of elements (menu, background-image, contact-form etc.) is visible on a blank page, and you are free to move them around, swap them out, change color, add functionalities and design the page more or less exactly how you want it. A visible grid divides the page in nine parts (left, center, right of heading, main, and footer) so that you always know exactly which part you place an element inside. This is important just not for the design, but also when it comes to responsive properties. If you are new to web creation this might be an unfamiliar term for you, so we will give you a quick explanation. A responsive webpage is one that fits on different devices with different screen width. In the modern world where a lot of people are using their mobile phones to browse the internet, it is absolutely vital to make sure that your webpage is responsive (relax, WIX handles this).
    </p>

    

    <h3 class="spacez2">Adding elements</h3>

    <p class="spacez">Adding new elements to your website is done through a menu on your left-hand side of the page. The menu is divided into the following categories: Menu and pages, background, add, theme-manager, add apps, media, my blog, bookings, content manager, and Ascend Business Tools. Some of the menu items are used for adding elements to your website, while others are used for example to create a blog post or add an app to your site. When it comes to adding actual elements on the side (by elements we mean for example a navigation box or a new heading), you can decide by a range of these. The great thing about a lot of the elements you can add, is that their functionality is already in place. If you for example want to add a submission form, you don’t have to do anything else than place it on your site somewhere, and the functionality of the submission form is already in place. It`s also possible to style the elements both in terms of design and functionality. For example you might want to change the size of a button, or make sure the button changes color when someone hoovers over it with a mouse.
    </p>



        <h3 class="spacez2">Apps</h3>

        <p class="spacez">We mentioned that you can add apps to your website with the WIX website builder. This is done via the Wix App Market. An example of an application you can add is the Wix Stores-app. Through this you can create a professional online store for your website. Things like secure transactions, order management and social media integration is already built into the app. This literally makes it possible for anyone to create their own online store. Another example of an app you can add is the Bablic-app, this makes it easy to create a multilingual website. There are a lot of apps you can add to your website through the Wix Stores-app. They great thing is that you can see how the different apps are reviewed by customers, this way you prevent ending up with a useless or not well functioning app. The ability to add quality apps to your website, is something we find really valuable with the Wix website builder. </p>

    <h2 class="headline6">SEO-tools</h2>



    

    <p class="spacez">If you`re planning on building a website in 2020 its vital that you consider SEO. SEO stands for search engine optimization and is what makes your website show up on different search engines (for example on google.com). Wix has a lot of different tools to boost your SEO, it helps you with creating keywords, get your website ranked, and makes sure you have semantic markup in your code. If you want, you can also hire a SEO-expert through Wix. The fact that Wix has included such powerful SEO-tools to their website builder might be one of the reasons that so many people use this website builder.
    </p>

    <h2 class="headline6">Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="spacez">The Wix website builder is easy to use, have professional looking templates, and great functionality. We especially appreciate the ability to add apps to your website, as well as making use of their professional SEO-tools. It`s hard to find any negative things about this website builder, but if we were forced to dig up one, it must be that Wix does not offer a customer-support chat. This is not noteworthy problem, however, as you can quite easily reach them on phone. Additionally, you will find answers to most questions you might have on their customer support webpages.
