        <h2 class="headline6">Introduction</h2>


    <h3 class="spacez2">Summary</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">
    
        Cloudways is an incredibly low cost managed cloud hosting. Not the typical shared hosting that other companies offer. Cloudways offers a good balance between performance, functionality and price. It is a very good option for users who manage multiple projects or have a websit
e with a lot of traffic that needs extra resources during certain times of the year.

If you want to try a managed cloud hosting and get away from the typical shared hosting with cPanel or Plesk then Cloudways is best suitable for you.

        
    
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="spacez2">What is Cloudways?</h3>
        
    
    <p class="spacez">Cloudways is a Managed Cloud Hosting platform, which allows you to choose from a series of cloud server providers and configure them quickly and easily. You will not have to worry about server maintenance, as technical assistance will be provided by Cloudways.

        With Cloudways, you will pay the server only for the time of use, and you will have the possibility to increase the resources at your disposal quickly, in case you need them.
        
        It is not a classic shared hosting, but a managed hosting able to connect to many different suppliers (e.g. Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Vultr, DigitalOcean).
        
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="spacez2">Who is Cloudways for?</h3>
    <h3 class="spacez2">For bloggers and those who manage a blog</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">

        If you have a blog and want to focus on your blogging business, without having to worry about initial application setup issues and the security or speed of the server hosting your blog, Cloudways is the right solution for you.
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="spacez2">For companies and professionals</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">If you have a company or are a professional and are looking for servers that are fast to implement, secure, easy to upgrade and with excellent speed performance, Cloudways is the answer.
        </p>
    
    <h3 class="spacez2">For digital agencies and web agencies</h3>
    
    
    
    <p class="spacez">The Web Services, who need to manage customer sites, will find a valuable ally in CloudWays. The speed of server and application impregnation, as well as the possibility of increasing the resources available "on the fly", are determining factors for the speed of intervention that is often required of agencies. 
        
        </p>
        <h2 class="headline6">About Cloudways</h2>
    <h3 class="spacez2">How does Cloudways work?</h3>
    
    <p class="spacez">
    
        Cloudways connects to the server of your choice and manage it for you (hence the term managed).

Cloudways, in fact:

        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li class="spacez">
                Create the server for you (you will not have to register on the third site).
                </li>
            <li class="spacez">It takes care of updating the server.</li>
            <li class="spacez">It offers you a panel with which you can easily manage the server in an easy and intuitive way (no system administrator or programmer skills are required).</li>
            <li class="spacez">It allows you to scale the server at any time (if you want to increase, for example, the RAM, you can do it with a simple click).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p class="spacez">
    
            In practice, with Cloudways you can host an almost unlimited number of sites since you have complete server management (without being a system administrator).
    
            </p>

            <h3 class="spacez2">Coudways prices and plans</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways is a cloud managed hosting, so in addition to not requiring technical skills, it allows great flexibility. You can choose the initial performance of a server and you can scale them in the future with a simple click. Even the prices, therefore, vary by vendor and performance choices. A server even starts at 10 euros a month!
<br/><br/>
                Like those of Cloudways, they use a pay-per-use system. At first, the prices may still be confusing or complicated because Cloudways works with several cloud hosting providers.
                <br/><br/>
                DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr are the cheapest options, with plans starting at $10-$12 per month.
                 </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Cloudways pricing with DigitalOcean</h3>
            <p class="spacez">With AWS or Google Cloud at least you will have to pay $33/month. Which is already a much higher price range. </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Cloudways pricing with Google Cloud</h3>
            <p class="spacez">If you contract a plan directly with one of those cloud hosting providers, it would be somewhat cheaper, but you would have to manage everything on your own. While with Cloudways, for a little more you get a managed hosting and you save all those pretty technical adjustments.
                If you want to try Cloudways, you can take advantage of its trial period. It is short, only 3 days, but enough to see how it works and assess if it is worth hiring any of their plans.
                <br/><br/>
                Plus, you don't even need to enter your bank details. So, they will not charge you anything after the trial period. Of course, the trial is only available for DigitalOcean, Linode and Vultr, which are the cheapest providers.
                <br/><br/>
                Managed servers, i.e. managed by third parties, have had very prohibitive costs for years. Thanks to Cloudways and its system, however, having an entire cloud managed server costs 12$ per month (in the case of the basic plan).
                 </p>
            <h2 class="headline6">Cloudways features</h2>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Supported cloud providers</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways allows you to choose between different cloud providers, facilitating and speeding up the process of creating a server, which will only take a few minutes.
                <br/><br/>
                Being a managed service, Cloudways eliminates all the technical complexities deriving from the installation and maintenance of the server, allowing you to focus solely on your business.
                 </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Domain, DNS and email management</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways takes care of the management of the servers on which to host your site but does not offer the possibility of registering a domain and consequently the management of the DNS and the creation of email boxes.
                <br/><br/>
                These operations must be carried out through a third-party service (for example, the classic Godaddy), which will then need to be pointed via DNS to the server created on Cloudways.
                 </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">General service overview</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways offers 24/7 support via tickets and chat ; has a pay-as-you-go cost model, and the first migration of a site is offered for free (but if you prefer, you can migrate yourself).
                <br/><br/>
                In addition to this, Cloudways offers the free SSL certificates of Let's Encrypt, has no contractual duration restrictions (it is possible to activate and stop a server at any time) and on the activated server it is possible to install all the sites we want.
                <br/><br/>
                The only limit is given by the resources available to the chosen server, but once they are saturated, it is possible to upgrade the machine on the fly, increasing its power or space, and therefore also the sites that can be hosted.
                <br/><br/>
                Cloudways allows you to install more than 10 CMS (which Cloudways defines with the term Applications ) with one click, including:
                 </p>

                 <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">
                        WordPress
                        </li>
                    <li class="spacez">Woocommerce</li>
                    <li class="spacez">Prestashop</li>
                    <li class="spacez">Joomla</li>
                    <li class="spacez">Magento</li>
                    <li class="spacez">and others, speeding up and simplifying the initial setup phase.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="spacez">Obviously, any applications that are not among those that can be installed through the 1-click installation of Cloudways, however, can still be installed by hand through the classic upload via FTP. </p>
            <h2 class="headline6">Advanced server and application management</h2>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Owner management panel</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Server management is carried out through a Cloudways proprietary Management Panel; this means that if you are used to the classic Cpanel or Plesk interface, you may initially find yourself confused.

                In reality, the use of the panel offered by Cloudways is very intuitive and beyond the initial bewilderment, you learn in a short time to use it.
                </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Server management panel</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways offers advanced management of servers and installed applications: you can stop, restart and delete the server whenever you want. It is also possible to clone the server, in order to create another one with identical characteristics. </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Management of services</h3>
            <p class="spacez">It is also possible to individually manage the services running on the server, restarting or stopping them if necessary.</p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Resource control</h3>
            <p class="spacez">
                From the management panel it is possible to monitor the use of available resources, such as RAM, CPU, disk space and bandwidth. By checking these parameters, you can check if your server needs an upgrade.
                 </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Changing PHP, MQSQL and web server parameters</h3>
            <p class="spacez">In addition to this, it is possible to vary a series of parameters relating to the server, such as the Execution Limit, the Upload Size Limit and the Memory Limit. It is also possible to change the parameters related to PHP, MySQL and Apache/Nginx, in case you need to make these changes.</p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Management of notifications</h3>
            <p class="spacez">It is also possible to receive notifications in real time, which notify you of important events related to the server. You can choose to receive notifications via different communication channels , such as Email, Slack or API. You can also choose in detail the type of notifications to receive, such as events about the health of the server and the applications installed.</p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Functionality for working groups</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways has been designed for the collaboration of work groups, in fact it is possible to add collaborators with different levels of permission, who can access certain areas of the control panel, such as the billing area, the support area or the server and application management panel.</p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Site cloning and staging area creation</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Another very useful function in Cloudways is the possibility of creating a staging area, which allows you to create an isolated clone of our Live site, so that you can carry out tests and changes, without having to make them visible on the Live version of the site.

                At the end of the changes, with a click you have the possibility to automatically copy all the changes you have made, from the Staging version of the site to the Live version. Any files you have edited in the Staging version will be updated on the Live version. The reverse operation is also possible (importing the changes from the Live version of the site to the Staging version).
                </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Cloudways performance and security</h3>
    
            <p class="spacez">If you are looking for a server with excellent speed performance, which allows your sites to load quickly, then Cloudways is the right solution for you. Unlike classic shared hosting, Cloudways servers have dedicated resources. As for the technical characteristics, Cloudways servers includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">SSD disks</li>
                <li class="spacez">Advanced caches already integrated (Memcached, Varnish, Nginx and Redis)</li>
                <li class="spacez">Multiple PHP versions available: from 5.6 to 7.3</li>
                <li class="spacez">CDN Cloudways</li>
                <li class="spacez">MySQL and Maria DB</li>
                <li class="spacez">Choose the datacenter closest to your audience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="spacez2">Cloudways security</h3>
            <p class="spacez">On the security side, Cloudways has implemented a number of best practices to keep servers safe and secure. In particular, we see:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Dedicated firewalls, to filter malicious traffic and block any intruders</li>
                <li class="spacez">Regularly installed security patches to fix vulnerabilities</li>
                <li class="spacez">Two-factor authentication , to add an extra layer of security to your account</li>
                <li class="spacez">IP Whitelist for FTP and MySQL, to authorize access to certain addresses</li>
                <li class="spacez">Free SSL certificate , to protect your site traffic with HTTPS</li>
                <li class="spacez">Automatic backups , which can be set at the desired frequency</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="headline6">Cloudways rating</h2>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Strong points</h3>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Easy to use admin panel</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways is quite easy to use, If you come from using cPanel or Plesk, it may surprise you a bit at first, but you will not get lost in their settings. Everything is very well organized and quite intuitive. </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Quick and easy application installation and management</h3>
            <p class="spacez">You can install WordPress, WordPress + WooCommerce, Magento, Drupal, Joomla, Laravel… with a couple of clicks, and manage everything in a simple way from the Applications. You can even create categories to classify the different websites you have. If for example you have a client with several websites, you could create a category and assign all their websites to that category.
                <br/><br/>
                Besides that, it is also very easy to clone the webs, use staging and since it generates a provisional url, you do not even need to link a domain. The latter is quite useful for creating websites and testing them.
                </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Pay per use or "pay as you go"</h3>
            <p class="spacez">It is a fairly flexible payment model because you do not stick to the typical annual plans. If you want to unsubscribe next month, cancel the plan and that's it. You only pay for the months that you had hired it.
                <br/><br/>
                With shared hosting plans, in most cases, you cannot do that because it is usually charged for a full year or at least a quarter (some allow you to pay month to month).
                </p>
         
            <p class="spacez">Another advantage of pay-per-use is that if at any given time you need more server resources, you can upload them and pay an extra just that month.
                <br/><br/>
                You don't have to upgrade to a higher plan and pay for a full year as with typical shared hosting.
                <br/><br/>
                This can also be used to test if more server resources improve the performance of your website or if speed problems are on your website.
                </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Negative points</h3>
            <h3 class="spacez2">It does not have a file editor</h3>
            <p class="spacez">In the cPanel or Plesk panels you can manage the files directly from the administration panel. In the case of Cloudways you have to do it by force by FTP.

                It is not that it is a great inconvenience, but sometimes it is more convenient to go directly to the control panel to edit a file and not be downloading and uploading files through FTP.
                </p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">They do not register domains</h3>
            <p class="spacez">Cloudways does not offer the option to register domains, what they do is create a temporary url for each application. You have to register the domains with another provider and then assign it to the application you want.</p>
            <h3 class="spacez2">They also don't offer email hosting</h3>
            <p class="spacez">By not having your email linked to the web hosting, if you decide to migrate the page or unsubscribe you will not have to migrate the email because you have it separate.

                But on the other hand, that implies that you have to hire a separate email hosting. 
                </p>
            <h2 class="headline6">Pros and cons</h2>
            <h3 class="spacez2">Pros</h3>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Easy setup and upgrade</li>
                <li class="spacez">Fast servers</li>
                <li class="spacez">Quality for a relatively low price</li>
            </ul> 

            <h3 class="spacez2">Cons</h3>

            <ul>
                <li class="spacez">Does not offer email</li>
                <li class="spacez">Does not register domains</li>

            </ul> 




            <h2 class="headline6">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="spacez">Overall, the service offered by Cloudways makes an excellent impression, and I would recommend it to those who need a more advanced service than the classic shared hosting, as it offers dedicated resources.
                <br/><br/>
                The ease of creation and upgrade of the servers, as well as the good speed performance, together with the ease of use, make it a high-level service for those who require high performance for their site, at an affordable price .
                <br/><br/>
                The only negative notes are the lack of Cpanel and the support offered only in English: however, these are minimal and easily overcome problems, which in the face of the numerous other advantages offered by the service.
