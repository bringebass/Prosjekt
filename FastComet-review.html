    <h2 class="spacez2">Summary</h2>
    
    <p class="spacez">
        FastComet is one of the lesser known hosting companies we recommend. Despite its competitive prices and impressive performance, the company is little known compared to other industry leaders such as GoDaddy and HostGator.    <br/><br/>FasComet is in a challenger position in the market but has quickly risen to be one of the preferred companies related to low prices, great customer support and web site security. The company has hosting plans suitable for most private individuals and small to medium size companies. 
    
        </p>
    
    <h2 class="spacez2">What is Fastcomet?</h2>
        
    
    <p class="spacez">FastComet is a web hosting provider established in 2010. However, it took until 2014 for the company to expand outside its headquarters in San Francisco.
        <br/><br/>
        Although little is known about FastComet, it has impressive server speeds, impressive security, and first-class support. Today, FastComet operates more than 11 data centers around the world and has more than 50,000 customers.
        <br/><br/>
        In order to cover global customers, the hosting company has server locations in top cities such as Chicago, Dallas, Newark (NJ-US), Toronto, Mumbai, Sydney, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Singapore, London and Tokyo.
        <br/><br/>
        Fastcomet is an emerging host company with late-comer advantages in technology and services. It may be the most cost-effective virtual host at present because it is still in the stage of cultivating customers, and the virtual host services provided are quite generous.
        
        
        
        </p>
    
    <h2 class="spacez2">Who is Fastcomet for?</h2>
    <p class="spacez">
        Because of a relative smaller number of customers (compared to the larger players), FastComet has made room to provide personalized support services. Whether you choose a low-level plan or a high-level plan, FastComet will ensure high customer satisfaction.
        <br/><br/>
        The most important thing is that the price is relatively fixed at a fairly low level. In addition, the renewal fee in the later period is the same as when it was purchased at the beginning, and the fee will not increase as the service life increases. This is a welcoming sign as the most known method to draw in customers in this industry is to have promotional prices that increase at the first renewal.
        
        </p>


                <h2 class="spacez2">How does FastComet work?</h2>
                <p class="spacez">FastComet this virtual host has good stability, up to 99.99% running time; loading speed is 1.27 seconds; customer service is also very good; the price starts at $2.95 per month.
                    FastComet shared hosting provides website administrators with a wealth of functions. Technical personnel and advanced users should prefer to use this virtual host.
                    <br/><br/>

                    FastComet is the best manageable dedicated virtual host recommended by foreign website virtual hosts, and its customer service quality is very high. FastComet provides fast domain name migration services, and the installation of website building programs is also very simple, such as WordPress and Joomla.
                    <br/><br/>
                    FastComet is undoubtedly the leader in manageable dedicated virtual hosting, with fast speed, high efficiency and good reputation. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition, FastComet is also among the best in terms of regular running time and ultra-high-speed loading times. The stable speed and abundant development tools make FastComet an ideal virtual host for building websites.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">FastComet Hosting Plans and Prices</h2>

                    Note: When you choose any of the above plans, an installation fee of $19.95 will also be charged. You can also choose to pay for additional features such as add-ons, online search engine optimization audits and Google sitemaps.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">The all plans provides at least:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">SSD, SSL, CDN, FTP</li>

                </ul> 

                <h2 class="spacez2">FastComet Hosting performance and Ease of use</h2>
                <p class="spacez">Although FastComet is relatively new and only entered the market in 2010, I find that most of its customers are impressed by its services. Below are the details of the performance and ease of use of the hosting provider.</p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">Free Domain Hosting</h2>
                <p class="spacez">FastComet guarantees 99.99% uptime to its customers. This means you can rest assured that visitors to your website will never find out that your website is down.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The hosting service uses the free Cloudflare Content Data Network (CDN) to ensure fast rendering for its users. This means that your site is hosted on different servers all over the world to reduce the distance of content propagation when clients make queries.
                    <br/><br/>
                    FastComet is created using standard cPanel, which makes it easy for both new and old users to use. cPanel has a friendly and intuitive interface, even for novices, you can learn and use hosting services as easily as professionals. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The FastComet control panel allows you to perform most tasks with just a few clicks. Some of the actions you can perform directly from the control panel include contacting customer support, managing hosting accounts, and launching new sites. .
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">FastComet Security </h2>
                <p class="spacez">When you decide to use a specific hosting service provider to host your website, it is important to ensure that its security system is good. FastComet goes to great lengths to ensure that customers' websites are not attacked.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Hosting service providers use a special application firewall that has been optimized for major content management systems such as Joomla, Magento and WordPress. In addition, each shared hosting account uses an isolated environment on the main server, so websites infected with files will not spread to others.
                    <br/><br/>
                    FastComet uses a free SSL certificate, which is encrypted using the SHA-256 hash algorithm. These certificates protect the connection faster than traditional types by encrypting the connection between the client browser and its web server. This means that your server data is protected by man-in-the-middle attacks. It also helps prevent phishing attacks and improve search engine rankings.
                    
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">FastComet WordPress Hosting</h2>
                <p class="spacez">Today, WordPress has become one of the leading platforms for developing blogs and websites. To ensure you are worth your money, FastComet provides you a hosted WordPress ready solution. </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">WordPress cloud hosting features on FastComet:</h2>
                <h2 class="spacez2">Price Transparency</h2>
                <p class="spacez">Many manufacturers are very cheap when registering, but the follow-up fee becomes more expensive. SiteGround has this problem.

                    Fastcomet promises that the follow-up costs are the same as when registering, and there are no hidden costs.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">Free Old Site Migration</h2>
                <p class="spacez">If you have a website on another service provider, Fastcomet can be migrated for free.</p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">The opportunity to use the service for free for life: </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Invite friends to sign up for Fastcomet and you will have the opportunity to use Fastcomet's services for free. </li>

                </ul> 

                <p class="spacez">Free Domain Name for Life extremely favorable price, higher than the technical indicators of other manufacturers, you can also use it by inviting friends without paying. Being a user is obviously beneficial.</p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">Applications</h2>
                <p class="spacez">FastComet has the helpful help of cPanel. For this reason you can count on a large number of applications available for your use.</p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">Additional features</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Free daily/weekly WordPress data backup to improve security.</li>
                    <li class="spacez">An expert WordPress support guide helps customers run their website as quickly as possible.</li>

                    <li class="spacez">Update your WordPress site regularly.</li>
                </ul> 

                <h2 class="spacez2">Customer Support</h2>
                <p class="spacez">If you want to evaluate the quality of your company, customer support is one of the main factors to consider. In this regard, FastComet does not disappoint.

                    Hosting providers use multiple customer support channels that can help attract multiple customers and resolve their queries. The most notable of these channels is the direct phone line, which allows you to talk directly with any of their professional employees.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can also choose to use their online chat, which allows you to contact a support representative directly. Although their chat may sometimes be delayed for a short time, it can take up to 10 minutes for the customer to resolve your query.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Other useful support channels include "FAQ" pages and tutorials. No need to call the company directly or initiate a chat, the "how to" tutorial makes it easy for you to learn about different components, such as migrating a website without hiring a developer.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="spacez2">Strong points</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">High safety factor, there are many advanced tools used by developers.</li>
                    <li class="spacez">SSL certificate and domain name relocation are all free</li>
                    <li class="spacez">Guaranteed refund within 45 days</li>
                </ul> 

                <h2 class="spacez2">Negative points</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Proprietary CDN is sometimes not intuitive to use</li>
                </ul> 

                <h2 class="headline6">Pros and cons</h2>
                <p class="spacez">Since its establishment in 2010, FastComet has been committed to ensuring that customers get the highest value for money. The following is a summary of the main pros and cons:</p>

                </ul> 

                <h2 class="spacez2">Cons</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li class="spacez">Although the cost of FastComet is relatively low, the connection fee of $19.95 has greatly increased the cost.</li>
                    <li class="spacez">If you join the FastComet StartSmart program, you can only host one website.</li>
                    <li class="spacez">Proprietary CDN is not always easy to use.</li>
                </ul> 
                <br/>



                <h2 class="headline6">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="spacez">Fastcomet is determined despite the relatively new and small customer base of hosting providers, the commitment to customer service is outstanding. Many customers using the service are very satisfied, especially its security and customer support.
<br/><br/>
                    The host's efforts to provide manageable WordPress solutions to further improve customer satisfaction is particularly impressed.
